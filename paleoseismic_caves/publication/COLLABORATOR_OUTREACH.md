# Collaborator Outreach & New Primary Data

**Last updated**: 2025-12-31

> **📋 Full publication strategy, email templates, and venue analysis in `PUBLICATION_STRATEGY.md`**

**The core problem**: This project is currently a **well-researched hypothesis** based on reanalysis of public SISAL data. For Nature/Science, it needs to become a **validated discovery** with new primary measurements and independent confirmation.

**Current state**: Zero collaborators contacted. Zero new data collected. Everything is self-validated computational work.

## Why This Blocks Publication

| Publication Tier | Current Readiness | Blocking Issue |
|------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Nature/Science | 25% | No collaborators, no new data, no independent validation |
| GSA Bulletin / JGR | 50% | No external peer vetting |
| Quaternary Science Reviews | 60% | Needs uncertainty quantification |
| Frontiers / PLOS ONE | 75% | Polish and editing only |

### 🔥 "HUNGRY REBEL" ASSESSMENT NOTES (2025-12-31)

**Miller/Winter**: Now #1 PRIORITY - see top of list above.

**Rejected candidates**:
| Researcher | Why Not a Fit |
|------------|---------------|
| Jacek Szczygiel (Silesia) | Physical damage method might see geochemistry as competition |
| Aurelia Hubert-Ferrari (Liege) | Too established (h-index 29, 27 yrs post-PhD), won't take risks |

---

### ⚠️ THE RIDLEY PARADOX (Must Address Before Contacting Lechleitner/Baldini)

**Ridley et al. (2015)** monitored Yok Balum during the **2012 M7.4 earthquake** and concluded speleothem records are NOT affected by seismic activity.

**Citation**: Ridley, Baldini, Prufer, Walczak, Breitenbach (2015). "High-resolution monitoring of Yok Balum Cave, Belize." *Journal of Cave and Karst Studies* 77(3): 183-199.

**Their finding**: No effect on cave atmosphere or drip rates from M7.4 earthquake.

**Why your hypothesis still holds** (must articulate in any outreach):

| Ridley 2015 | Your Hypothesis |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Short-term drip rates (hours-days) | Long-term isotope anomalies (decades) |
| Distant subduction quake (offshore Guatemala) | Nearby strike-slip rupture (Motagua, ~100 km) |
| Immediate hydrology response | Chiodini CO2 flux model (years-decades) |
| Cave atmosphere monitoring | Aquifer disruption / fracture network changes |

**Key argument**: Ridley studied IMMEDIATE effects on HYDROLOGY. You're proposing LONG-TERM effects on GEOCHEMISTRY via different mechanism (geogenic CO2 flux through newly opened fractures).

### For Remote Contacts

```
Subject: Potential earthquake signatures in [Cave] speleothem data - seeking feedback

Dear Dr. [Name],

I'm an independent researcher who has been analyzing speleothem geochemical
data from the SISAL v3 database. I found what appear to be earthquake
signatures at [dates] in the [Cave] record that you contributed to.

The signal shows [multi-proxy characteristics] that appear distinct from
volcanic/climatic forcing. I've attached a summary of my analysis.

I'm not affiliated with a university, so I'd especially appreciate expert
feedback on whether my methodology is sound. Would you be willing to take
a look?

Best regards,
[Name]
```

### For Tom Rockwell (LOCAL)

```
Subject: Tree ring anomalies overlapping your SAF paleoseismic dates

Dear Dr. Rockwell,

I'm an independent researcher in San Diego analyzing tree ring data from
Fort Ross and Gualala (Carroll et al. 2025). I found growth anomalies at
~1285 and ~1580 CE that overlap with paleoseismic date ranges from your
work at Carrizo Plain and Vedanta Marsh.

Specifically:
- ~1285: Tree ring anomaly overlaps Carrizo 1280-1340 AD and Vedanta 1290-1380 AD
- ~1580: Tree ring anomaly (z=-3.25) overlaps Carrizo ~1585 AD event

I'm not affiliated with SDSU or any university, but I live in San Diego
and would welcome the chance to get your feedback on whether this analysis
makes sense. Would you have time for a brief meeting or coffee?

I've attached a 2-page summary of my findings.

Best regards,
[Name]
```

### For Vasile Ersek (Oregon Caves 1700 CE)

```
Subject: Question about OCNM02-1 top section (1687-1716 CE interval)

Dear Dr. Ersek,

I'm an independent researcher analyzing SISAL v3 speleothem data for
paleoseismology applications. I noticed that the NOAA metadata for your
Oregon Caves record (OCNM02-1) lists the end date as 234 BP (~1716 CE),
but the published climate reconstruction appears to end at ~1687 CE.

I'm interested in the 1700 CE interval because it coincides with the
Cascadia M9.0 megathrust earthquake (precisely dated to January 26, 1700
from Japanese tsunami records). If the top section of the stalagmite
captured this event, it might show trace element anomalies (Sr/Ca, Ba/Ca)
from seismic aquifer flushing.

I have two questions:
1. Why was the 1687-1716 CE interval excluded from the climate reconstruction?
2. Is archived sample material from the top section available for
   trace element analysis?

I'd be happy to share my paleoseismology methodology if helpful.

Best regards,
[Name]
```

## Reality Check: Non-Academic Status

**The honest situation**: You have zero publications, no institutional affiliation, and no formal training in paleoseismology. This matters for:

| Challenge | Mitigation |
|-----------|------------|
| Cold emails get ignored | Lead with LOCAL contact (Rockwell), in-person meetings |
| No credibility signal | Let the work speak - attach analysis, not CV |
| Peer review skepticism | Get informal vetting before submission |
| Co-authorship risk for academics | Offer to do the work, let them take lead author if needed |

**What you DO have**:
- Months of computational analysis they didn't do
- Novel application of public data
- Local presence (for Rockwell)
- Nothing to lose

---

## Alternative Publication Paths (if collaboration fails)

| Path | Pros | Cons |
|------|------|------|
| **EarthArXiv preprint** | No gatekeeping, establishes priority, citable | No peer review credibility |
| **AGU/GSA poster** | Meet researchers in person, anyone can submit | Costs ~$500 + travel |
| **Frontiers/PLOS ONE** | Accepts independent researchers | Lower prestige |
| **Blog + Twitter/Bluesky** | Build audience, may attract collaborators | Not formal publication |

---

## Pre-Publication Literature Verification

**Before submitting, must verify these claims are accurate:**

| # | Claim | Verification Needed | Status |
|---|-------|---------------------|--------|
| **V1** | **δ18O geochemical earthquake detection is novel** | Systematic literature search for papers using speleothem δ18O or Mg/Ca anomalies to detect earthquakes (vs. physical damage). Initial web search (2024-12-30) found ZERO such papers - all speleoseismology uses physical damage, all δ18O work is paleoclimate. But must do formal database search (Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar) before claiming "novel application." | ❌ INFORMAL SEARCH ONLY |
| **V2** | **No prior Chiodini-to-speleothem connection** | Verify nobody has applied Chiodini's groundwater hydrogeochemistry framework to speleothem archives before. Search: "Chiodini" + "speleothem" in literature databases. | ❌ NOT DONE |

**Current framing in paper (Section 1.2)**: "Here we propose that δ18O anomalies... may also record earthquake-induced aquifer disruption. This geochemical approach complements physical damage studies..." — This is appropriately cautious and doesn't claim "first" or "novel."

---

## Paths to New Primary Data

| Option | Description | Timeline | Feasibility |
|--------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **1. Collaborate** | Contact Zunino/Shen for archived sample reanalysis | 3-6 months | HIGH - recommended |
| **2. Request reanalysis** | Ask Hu et al. to run δ13C on BA18-4 sample powder | 6-12 months | MEDIUM |
| **3. Fund fieldwork** | NSF/ERC grant for new Bàsura sampling | 2-3 years | LOW priority for now |
| **4. Methodology paper** | Frame as "new application of existing data" | 3-6 months | FALLBACK option |

### What Collaborators Would Provide

| Gap | How Collaborator Fills It |
|-----|---------------------------|
| No new primary data | Run δ13C on archived samples |
| No independent validation | Vet claims against unpublished data |
| No credibility | Co-authorship adds institutional weight |
| No archive access | Italian collaborator can visit ASGe, Vatican |
| No cave access | Zunino has Bàsura permits for new sampling |

## Task List

| # | Task | Effort | Status | Deadline |
|---|------|--------|--------|----------|
| **CO-LIT** | **Read Rose Canyon literature** (Lindvall 1995, Singleton 2019, Kennedy 1975, Sahakian 2017) | 3 hours | ❌ TODO | Before CO-0 |
| **CO-0** | **Prepare 2-page SAF findings summary for Rockwell** | 2 hours | ❌ TODO | **THIS WEEK** |

## Rose Canyon Dark Earthquake Tasks

| # | Task | Effort | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|--------|-------|
| **RC-1** | **1741 dark earthquake analysis** | ✅ DONE | Completed | Regional divergence PASSED, volcanic discrimination PASSED |
| **RC-2** | Kumeyaay archaeological disruption ~1740 | 2 hours | ❌ TODO | Could validate 1741 hypothesis |
| **RC-3** | Check if Rockwell's "mid-1700s" has date uncertainty overlapping 1741 | 30 min | ❌ TODO | Ask Rockwell directly |
| **RC-4** | **ML turbidite discrimination project** | 20+ hours | ❌ NEW IDEA | See details below |

### ML Turbidite Discrimination - Data Access Route

**Background**: Maloney/Driscoll (2017) failed to discriminate storm vs earthquake turbidites. But their work was PRE-ML.

| Step | Action | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Search [R2R](https://www.rvdata.us/) for Chief Scientist "Neal Driscoll", years 2011-2016 | ❌ TODO |
| 2 | Request SEG-Y files from SIO Geological Collections Curator | ❌ TODO |
| 3 | Obtain Goldfinger Cascadia labeled turbidites for transfer learning | ❌ TODO |
| 4 | Build ML classifier (texture + thickness + temporal clustering) | ❌ TODO |
| 5 | Apply to San Diego data, correlate with 1741 tree ring signal | ❌ TODO |

**File formats**: SEG-Y (`.sgy`), EdgeTech (`.jsf`)
**Python libraries**: `segyio`, `obspy`
**Key seismic lines**: Look for "SSB" identifiers (e.g., SSB003)

**Publication potential**: Standalone paper - "Machine Learning Discrimination of Seismic vs Storm Turbidites in the San Diego Trough"

See: `regions/north_america/ROSE_CANYON_ROCKWELL.md` Section 15 for full details.

**Data Location**: `data/scripps_segy/`

| Component | Specs | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| SEGY files | 3 files, ~12 GB total | ✅ Tar files moved to project |
| Navigation (P190) | 116 lines (sparker + boomer) | ✅ Downloaded & extracted |

| Coverage | 54.2 km² grid, 33.10-33.34°N, 117.62-117.87°W | — |

**Survey Location**: Offshore San Onofre (Camp Pendleton to San Clemente) - **60 km NW of La Jolla/Rose Canyon core area**

**Associated Cores (TN336 cruise, Jan 2016)**:

| Core ID | Type | Location | Key Result |
|---------|------|----------|------------|
| **BB 29-33** | Gravity | Shelf, within survey | **1,460 ± 20 yr BP** at 36-44 cm |
| **BB 13-14** | Gravity | Slope | Radiocarbon dead at 40 cm (reworked) |
| 62 others | GC/JPC | Slope SW of survey | 14 dated at WHOI + UCI |

**Cores archived at**: [Scripps Geological Sample Collection](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/collections/geological) - likely still available for sampling

**Recommendation**: Do NOT spend 8+ hours downloading/processing remaining SEGY. Instead, **email Neal Driscoll (Scripps)** about:
1. Whether TN336 cores show turbidite layers
2. Whether any cores extend to ~1741 (would need ~100 cm at 0.27 mm/yr)
3. Collaboration opportunity
