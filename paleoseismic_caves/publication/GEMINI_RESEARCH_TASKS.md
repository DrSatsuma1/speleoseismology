## Priority 1: Critical for Publication

### Task 1A: Human Mortality Data (1285 Italy)

I'm researching evidence for a previously undocumented M6+ earthquake in Liguria, Italy in summer 1285. I need to find or reconstruct human mortality data for the period 1284-1287 in the following areas:

**TARGET REGIONS:**
- Genoa and surrounding Ligurian coast
- Finale Ligure, Toirano, Albenga
- Nice/Provence border region

**SPECIFIC DATA NEEDED:**

1. **Parish burial records**: Search Google Books and Italian digitized archives for published transcriptions of:
   - "Libri dei morti" or "necrologi" from Ligurian parishes 1280-1290
   - Diocesan death registers (Diocese of Albenga-Imperia, Diocese of Genoa)
   - Any published cemetery archaeology from this period

2. **Charitable "gift pulse" quantification**: The Archivio di Stato di Genova (ASGe) has notarial records showing increased pro anima donations in 1286. Search for:
   - Published studies on Genoese testaments 1280-1290
   - Any quantitative analysis of "legati pii" or pious bequests
   - Studies of Genoa's Ospedali/hospitals in late 13th century

3. **The documentary gap AS evidence**: The Battle of Meloria (1284) left Genoa with 10,000+ POWs. Search for:
   - Mortality rates of Meloria prisoners 1284-1288
   - Contemporary chronicles describing conditions in Genoa during this crisis
   - Any evidence of civil disorder, famine, or epidemics 1284-1286

4. **Comparative mortality baselines**: To recognize an anomaly, I need normal death rates. Search for:
   - Medieval Ligurian population estimates
   - Any demographic studies of 13th century Liguria
   - Plague/epidemic chronologies for NW Italy 1280-1300

5. **Birth rate anomalies 1285-1288**: Search for:
   - Baptismal registers (libri battesimali) from Ligurian parishes 1280-1290
   - Any published demographic studies showing birth/baptism counts
   - Studies of family reconstitution for medieval Liguria
   - Look for: dip in late 1285/early 1286 baptisms, followed by spike in 1287-1288

   **Expected pattern after mass mortality event:**
   - 1285 Q3-Q4: birth rate drops (crisis period)
   - 1286 Q1-Q2: baptism dip (conceptions during crisis)
   - 1287-1288: baby boom (population recovery, remarriages)

   This "demographic echo" would be independent confirmation of a mass casualty event in summer 1285.

**KEY SOURCES TO CHECK:**
- Caffaro's Annales Ianuenses continuation (covers 1280s)
- Jacopo Doria's chronicle
- Archivio Storico Italiano volumes
- Atti della Società Ligure di Storia Patria
- Roberto Lopez's work on medieval Genoa

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
For each relevant source found, provide:
- Full citation
- Specific page numbers or sections
- Direct quotes if mortality numbers are given
- Link to digitized version if available

The goal is to find quantitative evidence (burial counts, donation spikes, mortality rates, baptism patterns) that would show anomalous deaths in summer-autumn 1285 distinct from the ongoing Meloria prisoner mortality.

### Task 1B: Castle/Church Damage Archaeology

Search for archaeological studies of structural damage or rebuilding phases in:

**TARGET STRUCTURES:**
- Castles: Castel Gavone (Finale), Zuccarello, Castelvecchio di Rocca Barbena
- Churches: San Biagio di Finalborgo, Santa Maria di Toirano, Albenga Cathedral
- Any structure in Ligurian Alps with documented 13th century reconstruction

**SEARCH FOR:**
- "Fase di ricostruzione" dated to late 1200s
- Seismic damage patterns (cracked walls, rebuilt vaults)
- Dendrochronology of replacement timbers
- Archaeological reports mentioning "evento sismico" or "crollo"
- Any building campaigns initiated 1285-1290

**KEY DATABASES:**
- Soprintendenza Archeologia publications
- Istituto Internazionale di Studi Liguri reports
- University of Genoa archaeology department publications

**OUTPUT:** For each structure with late 13th century reconstruction, document:
- Dating evidence (stratigraphy, dendrochronology, architectural style)
- Type of damage described
- Whether earthquake was mentioned as cause
- Full citation of archaeological report

---

### Task 1C: Published Speleothem Paleoseismology Literature Review

Search Google Scholar for all published work on speleothem earthquake detection:

**SEARCH TERMS:**
- "speleothem" + "earthquake" OR "seismic" OR "paleoseismology"
- "stalagmite" + "fault" OR "ground shaking"
- "cave" + "coseismic" OR "hydrogeological"
- "karst" + "earthquake" + "isotope"

**WHAT I NEED TO KNOW:**
- Who else has done this? (establish priority/novelty)
- What methodologies have been validated?
- Any failed attempts or critiques?
- Key authors to cite or contact
- What gaps in the literature does our work fill?

**FOCUS AREAS:**
1. Italian speleothem earthquake studies
2. Oxygen isotope responses to seismic events
3. Trace element (Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca) seismic signals
4. Cross-validation with historical records
5. Critiques or limitations of the method

**OUTPUT:**
- Annotated bibliography with 1-2 sentence summaries
- Identify the 5-10 most important papers to cite
- Note any contradictory findings or methodological debates
- Competitive landscape assessment: is our work novel enough for Nature/Science?

## Priority 2: Cross-Validation Evidence

### Task 2A: Volcanic Forcing Verification

Verify volcanic events that could create false positives in speleothem records:

**FOR 1285 ITALY:**
Search for:
- Volcanic eruptions 1282-1286 that affected European climate
- Ice core sulfate data for this period (GISP2, NGRIP)
- Tree ring frost rings or growth anomalies 1284-1286
- Historical records of "dry fog" or climate anomalies
- Known eruptions: any from Iceland, Mediterranean, or tropics?

**FOR 620 CE BELIZE (YOK BALUM):**
Search for:
- The 536 CE volcanic winter - did effects persist to 620?
- Any eruptions 615-625 CE in VEI 4+ range
- Maya records of "dark sun" or climate anomalies
- Ice core data for early 7th century

**GOAL:** I need to RULE OUT volcanic forcing as an alternative explanation for the δ18O anomalies. If no major eruptions occurred within ±2 years of the cave anomalies, that strengthens the seismic interpretation.

**OUTPUT:**
- Timeline of volcanic events 1280-1290 and 615-625 CE
- VEI (Volcanic Explosivity Index) for each
- Expected climate impact on Mediterranean/Mesoamerica
- Ice core sulfate values if available
- Assessment: could volcanism explain our anomalies?

### Task 2B: Klapferloch Cave Cross-Validation (Austria)

Search for published δ18O data from Klapferloch Cave, Austria:

**SEARCH FOR:**
- Any speleothem records covering 1280-1300 CE
- Look for anomalies synchronous with 1285
- Authors: Spötl, Mangini, Boch, Frisia (common Austrian speleothem researchers)
- Check SISAL database publications for Austrian entries
- Search: "Klapferloch" + "speleothem" OR "stalagmite" OR "isotope"

**INTERPRETATION FRAMEWORK:**
A synchronous anomaly in Austria would indicate either:
- a) Regional seismic event (Alpine fault system activated)
- b) Volcanic forcing (climate signal, not seismic)
- c) North Atlantic Oscillation shift (climate)

Need to distinguish these possibilities by checking:
- Mg/Ca data (if available) - would show seismic vs climatic
- Recovery time (>10 years = seismic, <3 years = climatic)

**OUTPUT:**
- Available Klapferloch data for 1280-1300
- Any 1285 anomaly present?
- Full citation and data source
- Authors' interpretation (if earthquake mentioned)

---

### Task 2C: Tree Ring Corroboration

Search ITRDB (International Tree-Ring Data Bank) and dendrochronology literature for:

**ITALY 1285:**
- Any Mediterranean tree ring chronologies showing 1285 growth anomaly
- Pinus species from Ligurian Alps or Maritime Alps
- Search: "dendrochronology" + "Liguria" OR "Maritime Alps"
- Look for: sudden growth release (canopy removal from landslides) or suppression (root damage)

**BELIZE 620 CE:**
- Mesoamerican tree ring records 600-650 CE
- Correlation with drought indices
- Douglas fir or tropical hardwood chronologies from Guatemala/Honduras
- Maya sites with dendro data: Tikal, Copan, Quirigua

**SEARCH ITRDB FOR:**
- Site codes in Liguria/SE France
- Site codes in Guatemala/Belize/Honduras
- Any datasets covering our target periods

**OUTPUT:**
- List of available chronologies with time coverage
- Any documented 1285 or 620 CE anomalies
- Contact info for data curators if raw data needed
- Full citations for published chronologies

## Priority 3: Regional Context

### Task 3A: SisFrance Database Query (1280-1290)

Search the SisFrance database (www.sisfrance.net) and French seismological literature for:

**SEARCH PARAMETERS:**
- Region: Nice, Provence, SE France, Côte d'Azur
- Time period: 1280-1295
- Any earthquakes recorded?

**IF NO RECORDS EXIST:**
Document that absence and compare to:
- Earthquake frequency 1250-1280 (before period)
- Earthquake frequency 1295-1320 (after period)

**ALSO SEARCH:**
- Annales de Nice
- Archives départementales des Alpes-Maritimes
- Any medieval French chronicles mentioning tremors

**INTERPRETATION:**
The ABSENCE of French records during a period when Italian records also vanish would suggest a regional documentation collapse - consistent with a major shared disaster affecting both sides of the border.

**OUTPUT:**
- Number of earthquakes recorded in SE France 1280-1295
- Comparison with adjacent periods (baseline frequency)
- Any gaps in French earthquake catalogs
- Assessment: is the silence suspicious?

### Task 3B: The Genoa-Pisa War Context (1284-1290)

Deep dive on Genoa 1284-1290 political/social conditions:

**RESEARCH QUESTIONS:**
1. Battle of Meloria (August 1284): exact casualty figures
   - How many Genoese died in battle?
   - How many POWs held in Pisa?
   - Prisoner exchange negotiations timeline

2. Economic collapse indicators:
   - Food prices, grain imports
   - Trade disruption (ships, merchants)
   - Tax revenue data

3. Civic unrest:
   - Riots, factional violence
   - Who was actually RUNNING Genoa during this crisis?
   - Any contemporary descriptions of chaos

4. Epidemic/famine:
   - Were Meloria POWs dying from disease?
   - Any plague or hunger mentioned 1284-1287?

**KEY SOURCES:**
- Annales Ianuenses (Genoese annals)
- Villani's Chronicle
- Roberto Lopez - "Storia delle colonie genovesi nel Mediterraneo"
- Steven Epstein - "Genoa and the Genoese"

**GOAL:** Establish that Genoa was in such chaos that earthquake documentation would have been impossible/irrelevant. The earthquake was just one more disaster in a cascade of catastrophes.

**OUTPUT:**
- Timeline of Genoa 1284-1290 with all documented crises
- Casualty estimates where available
- Assessment: would earthquake records have been kept during this period?

---

### Task 3C: Medieval Ligurian Fault Knowledge

Did medieval Italians KNOW about the Saorge-Taggia or other Ligurian faults?

**SEARCH FOR:**
- Medieval references to "la faglia" or earthquake-prone zones
- Any pre-modern geological observations in Ligurian Alps
- Chronicles describing repeated earthquakes in same locations
- Folk knowledge of "terre ballerine" (dancing lands)
- Place names derived from earthquake damage (e.g., "Crepa" = crack)

**WHY THIS MATTERS:**
If earthquakes were normalized/expected in this region, records might be INTENTIONALLY sparse. Compare to well-documented events in unfamiliar regions (e.g., Basel 1356).

**SEARCH TERMS:**
- "terremoto" + "Liguria" + medieval chronicles
- "scossa" + "Finalese" OR "Toirano"
- Historical awareness of seismic risk

**OUTPUT:**
- Any evidence of folk/chronicle knowledge of Ligurian seismicity
- Comparison with other Italian regions (Tuscany, Umbria)
- Assessment: were Ligurian earthquakes considered noteworthy?

---

## Priority 4: The 1394 Event

### Task 4: The 1394 "Dark Earthquake" - Full Investigation

For our second "Dark Earthquake" hypothesis (1394 CE, Ligurian Alps), search for evidence of:

**EARTHQUAKE RECORDS:**
- Earthquakes in NW Italy/SE France 1390-1400
- CPTI15, CFTI5Med, SisFrance entries
- Any local chronicles mentioning "terremoto"

**ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE:**
- Church/castle damage or reconstruction dated 1390s
- Same structures as Task 1B, but 1390s phase
- Dendrochronology, architectural style changes

**DOCUMENTARY GAPS:**
- Notarial records 1393-1395 (check for hiatus)
- Compare to 1285 pattern

**DEMOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE:**
- Mortality or demographic anomalies 1394-1397
- Baptismal/burial records if available

**KEY DIFFERENCE FROM 1285:**
The Black Death (1348) changed documentation practices - look for post-plague record-keeping patterns. Were records MORE or LESS complete after 1348?

**OUTPUT:**
- Complete evidence summary for 1394
- Comparison with 1285 evidence strength
- Assessment: is 1394 publishable alongside 1285, or separate paper?

## Priority 5: Central America (Yok Balum Cave)

### Task 5: Motagua Fault Paleoseismology & Maya Archaeology

**PALEOSEISMIC STUDIES:**
Search for all published paleoseismic studies of the Motagua Fault, Guatemala:
- Trench studies showing rupture history
- Any events dated to 600-700 CE
- Recurrence intervals for M7+ events
- Authors: Authemayou, Brocard, Burkart, Guzmán-Speziale

**MAYA ARCHAEOLOGICAL CORRELATIONS:**
Search for:
- Quirigua archaeological destruction layers dated 600-650 CE
- Any Maya site with evidence of 7th century earthquake damage
- Building collapse, wall cracks, abandonment phases
- Sites: Quirigua, Copan, Tikal, Caracol

**LAKE SEDIMENT CORES:**
- Lake sediment cores from Guatemala showing seismites
- Any cores covering 600-700 CE
- Amatitlán, Atitlán, Petén lakes

**GOAL:** Link our 620 CE Yok Balum speleothem anomaly to:
- Physical paleoseismic evidence (trenches, lake cores)
- Archaeological destruction (Maya sites)
- This would make it the EARLIEST dated Motagua earthquake

**OUTPUT:**
- All Motagua paleoseismic data for 600-700 CE
- Maya site destruction chronology
- Assessment: does our 620 CE event predate all existing records?
