## Abstract (150 words)

Earthquake hazard models depend on recurrence estimates from incomplete catalogs. We validate multi-proxy paleoseismology against the Cascadia megathrust chronology (8/15 events detected, 10.7× above random, p < 0.00001), then apply it to the San Andreas Fault (SAF) where five independent archives converge on a previously undocumented ~1285 CE rupture: (1) Vedanta Marsh paleoseismic trenching (1290-1380), (2) Carrizo Plain trenching (1280-1340), (3) Noyo offshore turbidites (~1300 ± decades), (4) Pallett Creek stratigraphy (1257-1322, 4 AMS samples), and (5) North Coast archaeological collapse (1250-1300). If confirmed, this "dark earthquake" implies SAF recurrence of ~156-189 years—not the ~250 years assumed in UCERF3. The South SAF is currently at 168 years since 1857, placing it at 89-108% of the revised interval.

## 1. Introduction: The Catalog Completeness Problem

- UCERF3 relies on incomplete historical record
- Pre-1769 California = zero written records
- Trenching finds events, but radiocarbon windows are wide (±50-100 yr)
- **Question**: Can multi-proxy convergence resolve timing ambiguities?

---

## 2. Materials and Methods

### 2.1 Speleothem Paleoseismology (Oregon Caves)
- Chiodini hydrogeochemical model
- δ18O, Mg/Ca as seismic indicators
- Recovery time discriminator (5-71 yr seismic vs. 1-7 yr climatic)

### 2.2 Turbidite Correlation (Cascadia)
- Goldfinger et al. 2012 chronology
- 15 events, independent marine sediment archive

### 2.3 Tree Ring Divergence (SAF)
- Carroll et al. 2025 redwood chronologies
- Divergence pattern = seismic (differential damage)
- Uniform suppression = climatic (drought)

### 2.4 Paleoseismic Trenching (SAF)
- Vedanta Marsh, Carrizo Plain, Pallett Creek
- Radiocarbon dating, event horizons

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Validation: Cascadia Megathrust Detection (53%, p < 0.00001)

*[Source: Current PAPER_2 Section 3.4]*

- 8/15 events DETECTED at z ≥ 2.0σ
- 10/15 with POSSIBLE (z ≥ 1.5σ)
- **10.7× enrichment above random chance**
- T11 (~3940 BCE): Strongest signal in 7,900-year record (z = -3.32σ)
- Temporal precision: T5, Event S, Event W all match to 0 years

**Key point**: Independent archives (cave calcite vs. marine turbidites, 400 km apart) show statistically unambiguous correlation.

### 3.2 Discovery: The ~1285 CE San Andreas Dark Earthquake

*[Source: Current PAPER_2 Section 3.5.1, PROMOTED]*

**Five-way convergence table:**

| Archive | Location | Date Range | Source |
|---------|----------|------------|--------|
| **Pallett Creek stratigraphy** | Big Bend (South SAF) | **1257-1322 CE** | Layer 61.4, 4 AMS samples |
| Vedanta Marsh paleoseismic | North SAF | 1290-1380 CE | Zhang et al. 2006 |
| Carrizo Plain paleoseismic | South SAF | 1280-1340 CE | Sieh et al. 1989 |
| Noyo offshore turbidites | Offshore N. California | ~1300 ± decades | Goldfinger et al. 2008 |
| Archaeological collapse | North Coast | 1250-1300 CE | 1250-1300 CE | Schwitalla & Jones 2008 |

**The Pallett Creek evidence** (the "irrefutable" trench data):
- Physical rupture horizon at Layer 61.4
- 4 independent AMS radiocarbon dates
- Calibrated range: **1257-1322 CE**
- This is the tightest chronological constraint

**Archaeological corroboration**:
- Settlement collapse 1250-1300 CE
- Trade network disruption
- "World Renewal" cults emerge post-1300 (designed to "stabilize the earth")

### 3.3 Supporting Dark Earthquake: ~1580 CE

*[Source: Current PAPER_2 Section 3.5.3]*

- Tree ring divergence (z = -3.25σ Fort Ross)
- Carrizo Plain Event 3 (1540-1630 CE)
- Offshore turbidite T2/T3 (contains 1580)
- Megadrought rebuttal: divergence pattern unexplained by uniform water stress

### 3.4 The 1825 Localized Rupture

*[Source: Current PAPER_2 Section 3.5.4]*

- Extreme Gualala suppression (z = -4.43σ, strongest in 627-year record)
- Fort Ross near-normal → localized segment rupture
- Proposed M6.5-7.0 Gualala Point segment

## 4. Recurrence Interval Revision

*[Source: Current PAPER_2 Section 3.5.5]*

| If ~1285 and 1580 confirmed | Traditional | Revised |
|-----------------------------|-------------|---------|
| Mean recurrence | ~250 years | **156-189 years** |
| South SAF status (168 yr since 1857) | 67% of cycle | **89-108% of cycle** |

---

## 5. Discussion

### 5.1 Why Five-Way Convergence Matters
- No single archive proves synchronous rupture
- Overlapping radiocarbon windows could be coincidence
- **Five archives from different systems** (trench, turbidite, cave, tree, archaeology) = convergent evidence
- Probability of chance overlap across 5 independent archives is extremely low

### 5.2 Implications for UCERF3
*[Source: Current PAPER_2 Section 5.5]*
- Paleoseismic misfit problem
- If dark earthquakes real → hazard underestimated

### 5.3 Limitations
- PROBABLE, not CONFIRMED
- Wide dating windows cannot prove synchrony
- Tree ring anchoring incomplete for pre-1400 CE

---

## 6. Conclusions

1. **Cascadia validation**: Speleothem paleoseismology detects megathrusts at 10.7× above random (p < 0.00001)

2. **SAF discovery**: Five independent archives converge on ~1285 CE, the strongest candidate dark earthquake in California

3. **Hazard implication**: IF confirmed, SAF recurrence is 25-40% shorter than assumed

4. **Call to action**: Targeted re-dating of Pallett Creek and Vedanta Marsh with single-year methods (dendrochronology, varves) could confirm or refute synchrony

## Figures (6 planned)

1. **Map**: California showing SAF, trench sites, tree ring sites, offshore turbidite cores
2. **Cascadia validation**: Oregon Caves δ18O with Goldfinger events marked
3. **Five-way convergence**: Timeline showing overlapping date ranges from all 5 archives
4. **Tree ring divergence**: 1580 and 1825 showing suppressed vs. enhanced trees
5. **Recurrence revision**: Before/after timeline if dark earthquakes confirmed
6. **Hazard implications**: South SAF probability curve under revised recurrence
