## Paper Structure

### Abstract (~200 words)
- Dark earthquakes = seismic events absent from historical catalogs
- Speleothem methodology (cite Paper 1) reveals multiple candidates
- 3 continents, medieval to prehistoric
- Implications for hazard assessment

### 1. Introduction (~500 words)
- Historical catalogs are incomplete (cite Paper 1 intro)
- "Dark earthquakes" concept: physical evidence without documentation
- Why they matter: recurrence intervals, hazard underestimation
- This paper: applying validated method to discover missing events

### 2. Methods (~300 words)
- Brief: "See [Paper 1] for full methodology"
- Site selection criteria for dark earthquake hunting
- Archival corroboration approach
- Evidence tiers defined

### 3. Results: Dark Earthquake Candidates

#### 3.1 Italy: The 1285 CVSE (~800 words)
**Source**: `regions/italy/THE_1285_CVSE.md`
- δ18O -2.46σ (#1 in 750 years) + Mg/Ca +2.25σ
- 319-year catalog gap (1217-1536 CE)
- Compound event: seismic + volcanic (1286 UE6) + hydrological (Genoa flood)
- Archival corroboration: Carthusian silence, notarial gaps
- Proposed magnitude: Mw 6.0-6.5
- T. Porra Fault as source candidate

#### 3.2 Italy: The 1394 Dark Earthquake (~600 words)
**Source**: `regions/italy/THE_1394_DARK_EARTHQUAKE.md`
- δ18O -2.16σ (#3), Mg/Ca +1.60σ
- NOT a Titan (lacks volcanic-hydrological coupling)
- Clean seismic signal
- Archival gap persists

#### 3.3 Central America: ~620 CE Motagua Fault (~800 words)
**Source**: `regions/central_america/YOK_BALUM_620CE_DISCOVERY.md`
- δ18O -3.6σ (strongest in 2000-year record)
- 46-year recovery (seismic diagnostic)
- Archaeological corroboration: Quirigua destruction
- Extends Motagua paleoseismic record by centuries
- Two-pulse structure suggests sequence

#### 3.4 California: San Andreas Candidates (~600 words)
**Source**: `regions/north_america/CALIFORNIA_CAVES.md`
- ~1285 CE: Paleoseismic overlap (1280-1380 window)
- ~1580 CE: Tree ring + Carrizo Plain overlap
- ~1825 CE: Extreme Gualala anomaly
- Framed as CANDIDATES, not confirmed
- Revised recurrence implications

#### 3.5 Additional Candidates (Brief) (~400 words)
**Sources**: Various regional files
- Caribbean: 7 pre-instrumental candidates (Dos Anas)
- Brazil: Lapa Grande ~96 CE (71-year recovery)
- Yok Balum sequence: ~495, ~700, ~827, ~936, ~1159 CE

### 4. Archival Corroboration (~600 words)
**Source**: `regions/italy/THE_1285_CVSE.md` (archival sections)
- Vatican petition gaps
- Notarial record disruptions
- Carthusian chronicle silence
- Why absence of records ≠ absence of events

### 5. Discussion (~800 words)
- Catalog completeness implications
- Hazard assessment: revised recurrence intervals
- The Ridley Paradox (why some caves don't respond)
- Limitations: dating uncertainty, attribution confidence
- Comparison to other "missing earthquake" studies

### 6. Conclusions (~200 words)
- N dark earthquake candidates across 3 continents
- Method validated in Paper 1, applied here
- Catalogs are systematically incomplete before ~1600 CE
- Implications for probabilistic hazard assessment
