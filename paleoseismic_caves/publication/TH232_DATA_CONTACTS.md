# ²³²Th "Trash Bin" Data Contact List

**Purpose**: Contact authors who performed U-Th dating on speleothems near our dark earthquake sites. Their labs measured ²³²Th as part of routine U-Th dating but likely discarded it as "detrital contamination." This data could provide independent seismic validation.

**Pitch**: "Your ²³²Th 'contamination' data may actually be earthquake dust signatures. We found 4× spikes at known seismic horizons in Bàsura Cave. Would you share your raw U-Th data including ²³²Th measurements?"

Subject: Request for U-Th ²³²Th data from [Cave Name] speleothem

Dear Dr. [Name],

I'm an independent researcher investigating earthquake signatures in
speleothem geochemistry. I recently discovered that ²³²Th measurements
(typically discarded as detrital contamination) may record earthquake-
induced dust mobilization in caves.

At Bàsura Cave (Italy), I found ²³²Th spikes of 4× background at depths
corresponding to two historically undocumented earthquakes (1285 and
1394 CE). The ²³²Th signal is independent of the δ18O/Mg/Ca hydrogeochemical
signature, providing dual-proxy seismic confirmation.

I'm reaching out because your [Year] publication on [Cave Name] includes
U-Th dated samples from a region with significant seismic activity. If
your lab retained the ²³²Th measurements from that dating work, they
might contain similar earthquake signatures at [specific depth/age].

Would you be willing to share the raw U-Th data including ²³²Th values?
I would be happy to:
- Share my analysis methodology
- Include you as co-author on any resulting publication
- Provide full credit for the data contribution

The key depths/ages of interest are:
- [Event 1]: ~[age] CE (corresponding to [earthquake])
- [Event 2]: ~[age] CE (corresponding to [earthquake])

Thank you for considering this request.

Best regards,
[Name]
```
