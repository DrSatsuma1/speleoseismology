# Fundamental Assumptions That Could Be Wrong

## Critical Analysis of Paleoseismic Speleothem Methodology

---

## 1. The Core Mechanism: Earthquakes → Aquifer Perturbation → Speleothem Signal

**Assumption**: Seismic rupture opens fractures that release deep CO₂ and old groundwater, which alters drip water chemistry for 10-20 years.

**What could be wrong**:
- The mechanism is inferred, never directly observed in real-time
- Chiodini model was validated for *springs* (Gran Sasso), not *cave drip systems*
- The "10-year recovery" signature could equally result from drought-driven aquifer concentration
- No direct evidence links Bàsura's aquifer to any mapped fault system

---

## 2. The Aquifer Connectivity Coefficient (C) — Unfalsifiable

**Assumption**: Modern earthquakes (1976 M7.5, 2012 M7.4) produced no signals because C ≈ 0; ancient events produced signals because C was high.

**What could be wrong**:
- **Circular reasoning**: C is inferred *from* the presence/absence of signals, then used to *explain* those same signals
- You cannot independently measure C before an earthquake
- This makes the hypothesis unfalsifiable: any null result → "C was low"; any signal → "C was high"
- The 620 CE event might simply have been much larger (M8.5+?), not better-connected

---

## 3. Seismic vs. Climatic Discrimination Works

**Assumption**: High Mg/Ca = deep water = seismic; Low Mg/Ca = meteoric = climatic.

**What could be wrong**:
- **Drought could concentrate any aquifer water**, elevating Mg/Ca without seismic fracturing
- Only **6 of 32 anomalies** (19%) have Mg/Ca data to test this
- **BA18-4 has ZERO δ13C measurements** — the key Chiodini discriminator cannot be applied
- Klapferloch "validation" shows **opposite-direction signals** (δ18O depleted at Bàsura, δ13C enriched at Klapferloch) — this could indicate different mechanisms, not corroboration

---

## 4. Dating Precision Allows Event Matching

**Assumption**: Anomaly at "1285 CE" matches 1285 earthquake.

**What could be wrong**:
- U-Th dating uncertainty: **±50-100 years** for last 500 years
- Linear interpolation assumes constant growth rate (untested for Bàsura)
- "1285 CE" could realistically be 1235-1335 CE
- The **319-year catalog gap** (1217-1536 CE) means both "dark earthquakes" fall in a period where *any* earthquake would be unrecorded
- No independent way to distinguish "dark earthquake" from "no earthquake" in this window

---

## 5. The "100% Match Rate" Is Meaningful

**Assumption**: 32 anomalies explained = methodology validated.

**What could be wrong**:
- **Post-hoc matching**: You searched until finding *some* explanation for each anomaly
- Search expanded to multiple catalogs (CPTI15 → DBMI15 → chronicles → volcanism → climate)
- Flexible temporal windows (±50 years) + multiple event types = something always matches
- **p = 0.004** is calculated as if this were a pre-planned blind test — it wasn't
- Proper test: Can you *predict* new earthquakes from speleothems before catalog lookup?

---

## 6. Null Results Support the Hypothesis

**Assumption**: 1887 M6.9 (offshore) null result validates that offshore earthquakes don't produce signals.

**What could be wrong**:
- **1887 was the largest documented earthquake in 1000 years** — if methodology works, it should show *something*
- More concerning: 1976 M7.5 (onland, Motagua Fault, 100 km) produced **no signal** at Yok Balum
- 2012 M7.4 (offshore, 200 km) caused **physical cave damage** but **zero hydrological response**
- These null results **falsify** the simple hypothesis that large nearby earthquakes produce speleothem anomalies
- Rescue hypothesis ("connectivity") is invoked only after inconvenient results appear

---

## 7. Archaeological/Historical Evidence Validates Geochemistry

**Assumption**: Notarial gaps, abbey abandonment, bishop deaths corroborate 1285 earthquake.

**What could be wrong**:
- **Most claimed archaeological evidence is UNVERIFIED** (per 2024-12-27 update)
- Notarial gap: ❌ "No one has actually queried the Archivio di Stato di Genova"
- Abbey seismic retrofitting: ❌ "NOT VERIFIED - sources not consulted"
- Death-bed gifts surge: ❌ Marked WRONG after rechecking
- River avulsion: ❌ **RETRACTED** (Massabò 2002 says shift was AFTER 13th century)
- Only administrative events verified — no earthquake-specific evidence confirmed

---

## 8. Regional Events Produce Regional Signals

**Assumption**: A local earthquake produces signal at local cave; regional event produces signals at multiple caves.

**What could be wrong**:
- Different caves have different aquifer depths, geometries, flow rates
- "Isolated signal" could mean Bàsura has unique sensitivity, not that the event was local
- Klapferloch detects 1285 at 600 km (δ13C) while nearby Italian caves don't — contradicts expected distance attenuation
- Signal "isolation" may reflect data availability, not true spatial pattern

---

## 9. Single-Proxy Z-Score Thresholds Are Diagnostic

**Assumption**: |Z| > 2.0 indicates significant anomaly worth investigating.

**What could be wrong**:
- Z-scores depend on choice of baseline period and σ calculation
- 20th century shows **7 anomalies (1925-1944)** marked "⚠️ CLIMATE?" — modern warming noise?
- Without multi-proxy confirmation, high Z-score distinguishes "unusual" but not "seismic"
- Only 6 anomalies have Mg/Ca; the other 26 rely on single proxy

---

## 10. Catalog Absence = Dark Earthquake

**Assumption**: If we find a strong anomaly and there's no earthquake in catalogs, we've discovered a "dark earthquake."

**What could be wrong**:
- **Absence of evidence ≠ evidence of absence**, but also **absence of evidence ≠ evidence of presence**
- The 319-year catalog gap could reflect:
  - Historiographical incompleteness (current interpretation)
  - Tectonic quiescence (alternative)
  - Weak events below catalog thresholds (alternative)
- Without independent verification (trench, turbidite, tree ring), "dark earthquake" remains speculation

---

## The Most Dangerous Assumption

**The methodology produces outcomes where every result confirms the hypothesis:**

| Result | Interpretation |
|--------|----------------|
| Signal + Catalog earthquake | ✅ Validation |
| Signal + No catalog earthquake | ✅ "Dark earthquake discovered" |
| No signal + Catalog earthquake | ✅ "Connectivity was low" |
| No signal + No catalog earthquake | ✅ (No problem — nothing to explain) |

**This is unfalsifiable.** What result would *disprove* the methodology?

---

## What Would Strengthen the Science

### High Priority
1. **Blind prediction test**: Identify anomalies in a new cave → predict earthquakes → check against catalogs
2. **Obtain δ13C for BA18-4**: The key discriminator is missing for primary evidence
3. **Independent dating**: Tree rings, turbidites, or paleomagnetic dating on same events
4. **Report uncertainty ranges**: "1285 ± 75 years" not "1285 CE"
5. **Explain 1976/2012 null results** before claiming 620 CE was earthquake-driven

### Medium Priority
6. **Structural mapping**: Link Bàsura aquifer to specific fault systems
7. **Test drought hypothesis**: Can prolonged drought elevate Mg/Ca without seismic activity?
8. **Additional calibration caves**: Find Italian caves with multi-proxy data covering medieval period

### Publication Framing
9. Present as **"methodology paper demonstrating detection potential"** rather than **"confirmed dark earthquakes"**
10. Explicitly acknowledge confirmation bias risks and unfalsifiability concerns

| 7. Archaeological | 1 | Conceptually valid | Unverified claims | **LIMITED** |
| 8. Regional Signals | 2 | Martinelli21, Mammoliti22 | None | **SUPPORTED** |
| 9. Z-Score Thresholds | 2 | Standard practice | 20th C noise concern | **NEEDS REFINEMENT** |
| 10. Dark Earthquakes | 3 | Catalog gaps documented, Fronzi21 (unknown faults) | Cannot confirm without trenches | **PLAUSIBLE** |

### Key Literature Findings

**STRONGEST SUPPORT**: Core mechanism validated by modern monitoring (SO₄ doubled after M6.5 - Fronzi 2021; tracer detection changed from never→detected - Mammoliti 2022)

**CRITICAL PROBLEM**: Dating uncertainty ±142 years average (Ersek 2008) means "1285 CE" could be 1143-1427 CE. This fundamentally limits event-matching precision.

**PARTIALLY RESOLVED**: Connectivity CAN be measured independently (tracers, isotopes, SO₄), but historical C cannot be determined retroactively.

|----------|-------|----------|-------|
| Geochemistry alone (δ18O z>2) | 32 | ⭐⭐ | Real data, interpretation contested |
| Multi-proxy (δ18O + Mg/Ca) | 6 | ⭐⭐⭐ | Limited to 19% of anomalies |
| Historical documentation | 9 | ⭐⭐ | Post-hoc matching |
| Archaeological corroboration | 3 | ⭐ | UNVERIFIED for 1285 |

## Conclusion

The geochemical anomalies are real. The interpretive framework has significant circular reasoning and confirmation bias. Addressing these issues before publication will strengthen the science and preempt reviewer criticism.
