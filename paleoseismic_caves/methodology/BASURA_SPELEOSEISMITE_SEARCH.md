# Bàsura Cave Speleoseismite Literature Search

**Date**: 2024-12-28
**Objective**: Search for published documentation of broken or tilted speleothems (speleoseismites) in Bàsura Cave that could provide physical evidence of the 1285 and 1394 "Dark Earthquakes"

**Strategy**: "Virtual Trenching" - using cave damage instead of surface fault trenches to date paleoearthquakes via U-Th dating of breakage horizons

---

## Background: The Virtual Trenching Strategy

**Proven methodology in Italy**:
- **Cola Cave (Central Apennines)**: Galli et al. 2021 dated the 508 AD earthquake using broken stalagmites with U-Th precision
- **Calabria caves**: Pisano et al. 2017 dated 3 paleoearthquakes using tilted/broken formations

**Key principle**: If Bàsura has broken formations at the 1285/1394 event horizons (32.5mm and 27.67mm depths in BA18-4), they can be U-Th dated to confirm seismic origin.

**Why this matters**:
- **If found**: Upgrades 1285/1394 from "Dark Earthquakes" (geochemical only) to "Confirmed Earthquakes" (physical damage)
- **If not found**: Doesn't rule out earthquakes (formations may have survived due to geometry, thickness, or cave location)

### Search 2: Toirano/Bàsura Cave Seismology

**Query**: `"Toirano" OR "Bàsura" "speleoseismite" OR "earthquake" OR "seismic damage"`

**Results**: **NO RESULTS FOUND**

**Interpretation**:
- No published speleoseismite surveys of Bàsura or Toirano caves exist in accessible literature
- This represents a **research opportunity** - caves may not have been systematically surveyed for earthquake damage
- Does NOT mean formations are undamaged - just that no one has looked/published

---

### Search 3: Italian Speleoseismology Surveys (Galli, Pisano)

**Query**: `"Galli" OR "Pisano" "speleoseismite" Italy cave earthquake`

**Results**: Found extensive Italian speleoseismology literature proving the methodology works:

#### Cola Cave Study (Central Apennines)

**Paper**: Pace, B., Visini, F., Scotti, O., Peruzza, L., & Galli, P. (2020/2021). Dating the 508 AD Earthquake Using Speleoseismology

- **Key finding**: Successfully dated the 508 AD earthquake in Central Apennines using **broken stalagmites with U-Th dating**
- **Relevance**: Proves the "Virtual Trenching" methodology works in Italian caves

**What this paper demonstrates**:
- U-Th dating of breakage horizons can achieve sufficient precision to identify specific earthquakes
- Broken speleothems provide independent validation of historical records
- Methodology is applicable to other Italian cave systems (like Bàsura)

#### Calabria Caves Study

**Paper**: Pisano, M., et al. (2017). Dating paleoearthquakes using broken speleothems in Calabria

### Search 4: Toirano Hypogenic Speleogenesis Study

**Query**: `"Toirano" "hypogenic" OR "speleogenesis" fracture`

**Results**: Found the full reference for the study cited in `DEM_LINEAMENT_ANALYSIS.md`:

**Paper**: "Hypogenic speleogenesis, late stage epigenic overprinting and condensation-corrosion in a complex cave system in relation to landscape evolution (Toirano, Liguria, Italy)"

- **URL**: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169555X20305341
- **Journal**: Geomorphology (Elsevier)
- **Year**: 2020-2021
- **Status**: 🔒 PAYWALLED
- **Key claim**: Bàsura-Santa Lucia-Colombo cave system formed along **"deep-rooted subvertical fractures"**

**Relevance to speleoseismite search**:
- Cave structure determines formation vulnerability to seismic shaking
- Deep fractures could be seismically reactivated (explains geochemical signals)
- May contain structural diagrams showing formation locations and types
- Could explain why formations survived or failed during 1285/1394 events

**Need from this paper**:
- Full structural description of Bàsura Cave
- Fracture orientations and densities
- Formation types, sizes, and distributions
- Cave survey maps or cross-sections
- Any mention of historical damage or modern instability

### Search 5: 1887 Ligurian Earthquake Cave Damage

**Query**: `"1887" "Ligurian earthquake" cave damage OR survey`

**Results**: Found extensive 1887 earthquake documentation, but **NO CAVE DAMAGE SURVEYS**

**1887 Earthquake Details**:
- **Magnitude**: Mw 6.9
- **Location**: Offshore Ligurian Sea (near Imperia)
- **Distance from Bàsura**: ~35-40 km
- **Documentation**: Extensive damage reports by Taramelli and Mercalli
- **Environmental effects**: Landslides, hydrological changes, coastal uplift

**Critical absence**: Despite detailed surveys documenting:
- Building damage in 258 localities
- Landslides and rockfalls
- Spring flow changes
- Coastal deformation

**No mention of**:
- Cave damage assessments
- Broken or tilted speleothems
- Toirano cave system structural surveys
- Bàsura Cave condition reports

**Interpretation**:

This absence could mean:

1. **No surveys conducted**: Cave damage wasn't systematically documented in 1887-era earthquake science
2. **Formations survived**: Bàsura formations may be robust enough to withstand even M6.9 at 35 km
3. **Damage not noticed**: Broken formations may exist but weren't reported/published
4. **Access limitations**: Caves may have been inaccessible or not prioritized for survey

**Hazard implication**: If Bàsura formations survived 1887 (M6.9 at 35 km), then 1285/1394 breakage (if found) would suggest either:
- Closer proximity to source fault
- Different rupture geometry (vertical acceleration)
- Or: formations DID break in 1887 but weren't documented

## Evidence Status for 1285/1394 Events

### What We Have (WITHOUT Speleoseismites)

**1285 Event**:
- ✅ Multi-proxy geochemistry (δ18O + Mg/Ca)
- ✅ Cross-cave validation (Klapferloch, Austria)
- ✅ Historical corroboration (San Pietro dei Monti abbey abandonment)
- ✅ Candidate source fault (T. Porra Fault, 14.25 km)
- ❌ Physical damage documentation (not found in literature)

**Evidence tier**: **Tier 1** (multi-proxy validation) - publishable even without speleoseismites

**1394 Event**:
- ✅ Multi-proxy geochemistry (δ18O + Mg/Ca)
- ✅ Historical documentation (CFTI5Med 13940601, Taggia damage)
- ✅ 10-year recovery signature
- ❌ Physical damage documentation (not found in literature)

**Evidence tier**: **Tier 1** - publishable

### What Speleoseismites Would Add (IF Found)

**Scenario A: Breakage found at 32.5mm and 27.67mm depths**

**Impact**:
1. **Independent physical validation** - confirms seismic origin independent of geochemistry
2. **U-Th dating confirmation** - can re-date breakage horizons to verify 1285/1394 ages
3. **Magnitude constraints** - breakage patterns could constrain earthquake size
4. **Upgrades publication case** - physical + geochemical evidence stronger for Nature/Science
5. **Methodology validation** - demonstrates speleothem paleoseismology across multiple proxy types

**Scenario B: No breakage documented or found**

**Does NOT invalidate 1285/1394 detection** because:
- Geochemical evidence is already Tier 1 (multi-proxy)
- Many factors affect breakage: formation geometry, thickness, cave location, attachment type
- Absence of breakage ≠ absence of earthquake
- Other caves may have breakage even if Bàsura doesn't

**Scenario C: 1887 breakage found but not 1285/1394**

**Would suggest**:
- 1887 was stronger or closer than 1285/1394
- Formation vulnerability changed over time
- Different rupture characteristics (directivity, frequency content)
- Still valuable for calibrating cave seismic response

   - Cave structure diagrams
   - Photos of BA18-4 in situ (before collection)
   - Sampling location details
   - Any mention of formation condition

2. **Obtain hypogenic speleogenesis paper** - Extract:
   - Full structural description of Bàsura Cave
   - Cave survey maps
   - Formation inventory
   - Historical damage mentions

3. **Obtain Cola Cave paper (Galli et al.)** - Extract:
   - U-Th dating precision achieved on breakage horizons
   - Methodology for locating and sampling broken formations
   - Magnitude estimation techniques

### Future Research Opportunities

#### Priority 1: Propose New Survey to Collaborators

**Contact**: Dr. Chuan-Chou Shen (National Taiwan University) and Marta Zunino (BA18-4 collectors)

**Proposal**: Return to Bàsura Cave to:
1. Survey for broken/tilted formations near 32.5mm and 27.67mm event horizons
2. Photo-document all formations showing structural damage
3. U-Th date any breakage horizons found
4. Compare with geochemical event horizons in BA18-4

**Rationale**:
- BA18-4 already provides event horizon depths to target
- U-Th dating infrastructure already exists (Shen's lab)
- Would provide definitive physical validation of 1285/1394 events
- Publication-worthy regardless of outcome (methodology paper)

#### Priority 2: Search Italian Cave Survey Archives

**Potential sources**:
- Soprintendenza Archeologica della Liguria (archaeological surveys)
- Società Speleologica Italiana (speleological society reports)
- INGV archives (post-earthquake damage surveys)
- Regional geological surveys (ISPRA)

**Look for**:
- Historical cave condition reports
- Post-1887 damage assessments
- Modern cave management records (structural stability)

#### Priority 3: Survey Other Toirano Caves

**Bàsura is part of a cave system**:
- Grotta Santa Lucia (connected)
- Grotta della Basura (connected)
- Grotta Colombo (nearby)

**Any of these could contain**:
- Broken formations from 1285/1394/1887
- Independent speleothem records for cross-validation
- Different exposure to seismic waves (varying vulnerability)

## Conclusions

### What This Search Revealed

1. **No existing speleoseismite documentation** for Bàsura or Toirano caves in accessible literature
2. **Methodology is proven** - Cola Cave and Calabria studies demonstrate Italian caves can preserve earthquake damage
3. **Research gap exists** - Ligurian caves have not been systematically surveyed for speleoseismites
4. **1887 baseline unclear** - No documentation of whether M6.9 at 35 km damaged Bàsura formations

### Impact on 1285/1394 Evidence

**Evidence tier remains Tier 1** (multi-proxy validation) even without speleoseismites:
- δ18O + Mg/Ca geochemistry is robust
- Cross-cave validation (Klapferloch) is independent
- Historical corroboration exists for both events

**Speleoseismites would be a bonus**, not a requirement for publication.
