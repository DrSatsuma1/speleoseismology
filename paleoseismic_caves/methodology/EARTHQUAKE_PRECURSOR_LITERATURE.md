## Agent Skim Assessment (2024-12-29)

**5 papers skimmed by parallel agents. Results:**

### ✅ PAPER #17: INDEXED (Validates Chiodini Model)

**Boschetti, T., Barbieri, M., Barberio, M.D., Billi, A., Franchini, S., & Petitta, M. (2019).** "CO2 Inflow and Elements Desorption Prior to a Seismic Sequence, Amatrice‐Norcia 2016, Italy." *Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems*. https://doi.org/10.1029/2018GC008117

**Key Findings:**
- **Pre-seismic CO2 flux** increased in groundwater months before Amatrice M6.0
- **Arsenic (As)**: Baseline ~2 μg/L → anomaly 15-32 μg/L ("among largest ever observed before a seismic event")
- **Vanadium (V)**: Baseline ~2 μg/L → anomaly 20-30 μg/L
- **Boron (B)**: Slight increase + δ11B dropped from +7.5‰ → +2.8‰ (confirms desorption from mineral surfaces)
- **Mechanism**: CO2 inflow → pH drop → trace element desorption from HFO (hydrous ferric oxide) and clays
- **Precursor timing**: April 2016 (4 months before Aug 24, 2016 M6.0 mainshock)
- **Detection distance**: ~70 km from epicenter (Sulmona monitoring site)

**Quantitative Thresholds (from Table 2):**
| Parameter | Background | Cutoff | Warning | Triggering |
|-----------|------------|--------|---------|------------|
| Cext (mol) | 2.31E-03 | 4.0E-03 | 5.5E-03 | ~7.0E-03 |
| logfCO2 | -2.0 | -1.5 | -1.2 | -1.0 |

**Why Essential**: Directly validates earthquake → CO2 → trace element pathway. Multi-element approach mirrors our δ18O + Mg/Ca + δ13C discrimination strategy. Same Italian seismic sequence as De Luca et al. 2018.

**Status**: ✅ INDEXED (175 chunks, 2024-12-30)

---

### ❌ PAPER #33: NOT USEFUL

**Hydroseismograms at Gran Sasso aquifer (2025)** - Nature Scientific Reports

- Focuses on earthquake *detection* via hydraulic pressure waves, not geochemistry
- 1068 earthquakes over 8.5 years, 13.9% detection rate
- **No precursory signals documented** - reactive detection only
- Different mechanism than speleothem geochemistry

**Verdict**: Skip. Only useful if cross-validating 2016 Amatrice pressure response.

---

### ⚠️ PAPER #38: CONTEXT ONLY

**Hydrogeochemical seismic responses in karst aquifers (2020)** - MDPI Minerals

- Meta-analysis of 30 years of Italian karst studies
- Documents changes in: Ca, Mg, Na, Cl, SO4, HCO3, As, V, Fe, Cr, δ18O, δ13C, 87Sr/86Sr
- **Key insight**: Local geologic setting (fractures, permeability) drives response more than earthquake magnitude/distance
- Reports both pre-seismic (months) and co-seismic changes

**Verdict**: Useful background. Does NOT directly address speleothem formation chemistry.

---

### ❌ PAPER #50: NOT USEFUL

**Spring δ18O changes from earthquakes (2023)** - Frontiers

- Studies spring water, not speleothems (different system)
- M3.5-4.9 earthquakes (below our M6+ threshold)
- 1-2 month recovery (too short for speleothem multi-year anomalies)
- **Weak quantification**: δ18O shift magnitudes not reported in permil

**Verdict**: Skip. Timescale and magnitude incompatible with speleothem paleoseismology.

---

### ⏳ PAPER #27: INTERRUPTED

**Water geochemistry and stable isotope changes (2024)** - AGU GC

- Agent interrupted before completion
- Title promising: "stable isotope changes record groundwater mixing after earthquake"
- May have useful δ18O data

**Status**: Consider manual review if time permits.

---

### ✅ PAPER #39: READ FOR CONTEXT (50-Year Italian Synthesis)

**Martinelli et al. 2021** "Tectonic-related geochemical and hydrological anomalies in Italy during the last fifty years" *Minerals* 11(2):107

**Key Findings:**
- 50-year synthesis across **12 Italian regions** (1970s-2020)
- Distance-magnitude formula: **Log D(km) = 0.28 × M + 0.25** (anomalies detected to ~250 km)
- Precursors documented: Sicily 1990 (2 days), Toscana M3.7 (12 days), Gran Sasso 2016 (multiple)
- Monitored: CO2, radon, T, EC, pressure, flow rate

**Verdict**: ✅ Highly recommended. Authoritative INGV synthesis, establishes Italian baseline.

---

### ✅ PAPER #41: READ (Yellowstone 2025 - Novel Approach)

**2025 PNAS Nexus** "Seismic shifts in geochemical and microbial composition of Yellowstone aquifer"

**Key Findings:**
- 2021 swarms → increased H2, sulfide, dissolved organic carbon
- Microbial community responded to nutrient blooms
- Transient effect—returned to baseline after seismicity

**Verdict**: ✅ Worth reading. Validates earthquake-geochemistry coupling via different proxies.

---

### ✅ PAPER #36: READ (Complementary Paleoseismic Method)

**Bons et al. 2019** "Cockade structures as a paleo-earthquake proxy" *Nature Scientific Reports*

**Key Findings:**
- Cockades = rock fragments with hydrothermal quartz rims in fault breccias
- Growth rims record: mainshock (rapid flow) → aftershocks (multiple rims) → interseismic (settling)
- Calculated paleomagnitudes 4-5, rupture rates (1.2-0.3 min), interseismic ~2,880 years

**Verdict**: ✅ Read for complementary mechanical constraints. Different from speleothems but validates subsurface earthquake response.

---

### ⚠️ PAPER #22: MODERATE UTILITY (Boron Precursors)

**HydroQuakes monitoring network** (2021)

**Key Findings:**
- Boron (B) and δ11B anomalies preceded Mw 4.1 earthquake
- Threshold: precursors mostly for Mw ≥ 5.0
- Multi-parameter monitoring (B, As, V, Fe, pH, T, EC, δ18O, δ2H)

**Verdict**: ⚠️ Moderate. Complementary trace element approach, not direct CO2 validation.

---

### ❌ PAPER #5: LIMITED UTILITY (Iceland Different Setting)

**Iceland trace elements 2010-2018** (2021)

**Key Findings:**
- Li, B, Ga, Mo, Sr, Rb, Fe changed before Mw 5.0 and Bárðarbunga eruption
- 8 months to 1 day advance for volcanic; earthquake timing unclear
- Borehole 80 km from epicenter

**Verdict**: ❌ Limited. Different setting, but validates trace elements respond to crustal stress. Cite for proxy justification only.

- **Critical finding**: Magnitude-distance threshold for detection:
  - Mw ≥ 7.6: Detectable at any distance (all 11 events detected)
  - Mw 6.5-7.5: Distance-dependent (7/11 detected)
  - Mw < 6.5: Rarely detected
- **Mechanism**: Rayleigh wave propagation → pressure oscillations → groundwater level spikes (5-35 min)
- **Application**: Use to establish which historical earthquakes *should* leave speleothem signatures

**#13 - Barbieri, M. et al. (2020)** "Tracing deep fluid source contribution to groundwater in an active seismic area." *Journal of Hydrology* 582:124495. DOI: 10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124495

- **Critical finding**: Deep CO2 is primary driver of hydrogeochemical changes; pre-seismic crustal dilation triggers excess CO2 release
- **Method**: Coupled δ13C + Na/Li geothermometry distinguishes deep vs shallow fluids
- **Deep fluid temperatures**: 113-130°C (matches borehole data)
- **Application**: Validates CO2 mechanism underpinning speleothem δ13C discrimination

**#7 - Petitta, M. et al. (2018)** "Water-table and discharge changes associated with the 2016–2017 seismic sequence in central Italy." *Hydrogeology Journal* 26:1009-1026. DOI: 10.1007/s10040-017-1717-7

- **Dormant spring reactivation**: Torbidone spring (dry since 1979) reached 1.6 m³/s after Mw 6.5
- **Application**: Validates multi-month hydrological response relevant to speleothem recording

- #21: Deep learning for Gran Sasso aquifer
- #22: HydroQuakes monitoring network
- #26: Earthquake signals via hydrogeochemical + satellite
- #27: Water geochemistry changes after earthquakes (2024)
- #29: Groundwater circulation in karst (validates cave sensitivity)
- #33: Hydroseismograms at Gran Sasso (2025, latest!)
- #37: Effects on groundwater discharge (2016 sequence)
- #38: Hydrogeochemical seismic responses in karst
- #42: How earthquakes reshape carbonate aquifers (2026, future?)
- #51: MUDA multiparametric database (could have raw data!)

**MEDIUM PRIORITY** (precursor signals, trace elements):

- #2: Critical review of earthquake precursors
- #5: Trace element changes (Iceland - different setting)
- #9: Benevento seismic swarm (2022)
- #10: Trends in earthquake precursors research
- #13: Deep fluid source contribution

## Next Steps

1. **Download PDFs** for all high-priority papers (prioritize #17, #27, #33, #37, #38, #42, #51)
2. **Index into RAG database** using `tools/rag.py index <path>`
3. **Extract key findings** for PAPER_2_DARK_EARTHQUAKES.md Discussion section
4. **Check MUDA database (#51)** - may contain raw Gran Sasso monitoring data
5. **Contact authors** of #22 (HydroQuakes) and #33 (2025 hydroseismograms) for collaboration
