# Next Session: Speleoseismite Search Continuation

## Status: P4 Complete - Literature Search Phase Done

All web searches completed (2024-12-28). No published speleoseismite surveys found for Bàsura.

## What Was Accomplished

✅ Executed 5 literature searches:
1. Hu et al. 2022 primary papers (found but paywalled)
2. Toirano/Bàsura seismology (no results)
3. Italian speleoseismology methodology (found Cola Cave, Calabria studies)
4. Hypogenic speleogenesis study (found but paywalled)
5. 1887 earthquake cave damage (extensive EQ docs, but NO cave surveys)

✅ Files created:
- `methodology/BASURA_SPELEOSEISMITE_SEARCH.md` - Complete search results
- `methodology/MATERIALS_NEEDED.md` - Paywalled papers list
- `methodology/NEXT_SESSION_SPELEOSEISMITE.md` - This file

✅ Files updated:
- `GAPS_AND_PRIORITIES.md` - P4 marked complete

## PDF Obtained

**Hu et al. 2022 "Split westerlies over Europe in the early Little Ice Age"**
- Location: `/Users/catherine/Downloads/s41467-022-34952-9.pdf`
- Status: Ready to analyze

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session)

1. **Read the Hu et al. 2022 PDF** using Read tool
   - Look for: cave structure, sampling location, formation photos
   - Search for: "broken", "tilted", "damaged", "collapse", "structure", "survey"
   - Check Methods section and Supplementary Information

2. **If paper has useful info**: Update `BASURA_SPELEOSEISMITE_SEARCH.md` with findings

3. **If paper mentions broken formations**:
   - Update `regions/italy/THE_1285_TITAN_EVENT.md`
   - Update `publication/PAPER_2_DARK_EARTHQUAKES.md` Section 3.1
   - Upgrade evidence tier if appropriate

### Follow-up (Future)

4. **Obtain second Hu et al. paper** (s41467-022-31854-w) - title unknown
5. **Obtain hypogenic speleogenesis paper** - describes cave structure
6. **Contact Zunino/Shen** (P5) - ask about observed cave damage

## Key Finding

**Research gap identified**: No systematic speleoseismite surveys of Ligurian caves exist in published literature. This is an **opportunity**, not a problem - our 1285/1394 events remain Tier 1 evidence without speleoseismites.

## Command to Resume

When user says "continue with speleoseismite search":
- Read `/Users/catherine/Downloads/s41467-022-34952-9.pdf`
- Extract cave structure information
- Update search results document

**Session ended**: 2024-12-28
**Resume with**: Read Hu et al. 2022 PDF and document findings
