## Priority 1: Bàsura Cave Speleoseismite Search

### Hu et al. 2022 Nature Communications Papers

**Paper 1**: "Split westerlies over Europe in the early Little Ice Age"
- **Status**: ✅ OBTAINED - PDF at `/Users/catherine/Downloads/s41467-022-34952-9.pdf`
- **URL**: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-34952-9
- **Citation**: Nature Communications 13:4898 (2022)
- **Why needed**: Primary data source for BA18-4 speleothem. Need to check:
  - Cave structure descriptions
  - Sampling location (wall vs. floor stalagmite)
  - Photos of cave interior
  - Any mention of broken/damaged formations
  - Speleothem size, shape, condition
  - Supplementary materials with site photos

**Paper 2**: Second Hu et al. 2022 Nature Communications paper
- **Status**: 🔒 PAYWALLED
- **URL**: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-31854-w
- **Citation**: Nature Communications 13:7866 (2022)
- **Why needed**: May contain additional cave survey information or photos not in first paper

**What to look for in these papers**:
1. Methods section - how was BA18-4 collected?
2. Site description - any structural details about Bàsura Cave?
3. Figures/photos - any images showing the cave interior or formations?
4. Supplementary Information - often contains site photos and detailed methods
5. Keywords to search: "broken", "tilted", "damaged", "collapsed", "speleoseismite", "structural", "survey"

## Priority 2: Italian Speleoseismology Methodology

### Cola Cave Study (Central Apennines)

**Paper**: Pace et al. 2020/2021 - Dating the 508 AD earthquake using speleoseismites
- **Status**: ⏳ PENDING (may be open access on AGU)
- **URL**: https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020TC006289
- **Citation**: Tectonics (AGU)
- **Why needed**:
  - Proven methodology for U-Th dating broken speleothems
  - Compare their approach to our 1285/1394 event horizons
  - Check if they suggest survey protocols we could apply to Bàsura

**What to extract**:
- U-Th dating precision achieved
- How they located breakage horizons
- Magnitude estimation from breakage patterns
- Cave survey methodology

## Priority 3: Toirano Hypogenic Speleogenesis

**Paper**: "Hypogenic speleogenesis, late stage epigenic overprinting and condensation-corrosion in a complex cave system in relation to landscape evolution (Toirano, Liguria, Italy)"
- **Status**: 🔒 PAYWALLED
- **URL**: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169555X20305341
- **Journal**: Geomorphology (Elsevier)
- **Year**: 2020-2021
- **Why needed**:
  - Describes "deep-rooted subvertical fractures" that formed Bàsura-Santa Lucia-Colombo system
  - Cave structure may explain formation vulnerability or stability
  - Fracture orientations could relate to seismic susceptibility

**What to extract**:
- Full structural description of Bàsura Cave
- Fracture orientations and densities
- Formation types and distributions
- Any mention of historical damage or repairs
- Cave survey maps or diagrams

## Priority 4: Calabria Speleoseismite Study

**Paper**: Pisano et al. 2017 - Dating 3 paleoearthquakes in Calabria caves
- **Status**: 🔒 PAYWALLED (likely)
- **URL**: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1040618216303767
- **Citation**: Quaternary Science Reviews
- **Why needed**:
  - Comparison methodology for southern Italy
  - Check if similar geological setting to Liguria
  - Dating precision comparison

## Alternative Access Strategies

If you have institutional access:
1. Try accessing through university library proxy
2. Check ResearchGate for author-shared preprints
3. Email authors directly requesting PDFs (often provided freely)
4. Check if supplementary materials are open even if main paper is paywalled

**For Hu et al. papers specifically**:
- Check if Dr. Chuan-Chou Shen (co-author) has shared on ResearchGate
- Nature Communications is open access - 303 redirect may be temporary issue
- Try accessing from different network (some institutions have IP-based access)

## How to Provide Materials

When you obtain these papers, you can:
1. Save PDFs to: `/Users/catherine/projects/quake/paleoseismic_caves/papers/`
2. Tell Claude: "I've added [paper name] to the papers folder"
3. Claude will use the Read tool to analyze the PDF
