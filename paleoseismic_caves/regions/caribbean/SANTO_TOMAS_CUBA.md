## Anomaly Analysis

### Top 10 δ18O Anomalies

| Age (BP) | δ18O (‰) | Z-score |
|----------|----------|---------|
| 6,937 | -4.18 | -3.70 |
| 6,948 | -4.13 | -3.64 |
| 6,926 | -3.94 | -3.44 |
| 6,959 | -3.89 | -3.39 |
| 66,690 | -3.86 | -3.36 |

| 7,441 | -3.51 | -2.98 |

**Note:** Strong δ18O negative cluster at 6,915-7,000 BP likely reflects enhanced monsoon/precipitation during early Holocene thermal maximum.

| 12,870 | 37.72 | +3.87 |
| 13,101 | 36.32 | +3.56 |
| 12,881 | 35.77 | +3.45 |
| 12,859 | 35.47 | +3.38 |

| 13,333 | 34.05 | +3.07 |

**Note:** Strong Mg/Ca cluster at 12,800-13,400 BP coincides with the **Younger Dryas** cold period.

## Multi-Proxy Seismic Signature Detection

### Methodology
Seismic events produce a distinctive signature: **negative δ18O** (fresh/deep water influx) + **positive Mg/Ca** (elevated trace elements from disturbed aquifer).

### Results

| Threshold | Events Detected |
|-----------|-----------------|
| \|z\| > 2.0 | 0 |
| \|z\| > 1.5 | **1** |
| \|z\| > 1.0 | 41 |

### Potential Seismic Event: 8,756 BP

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Age | 8,756 ± ~50 BP |
| δ18O | -2.53‰ (z = -1.94) |
| Mg/Ca | 28.93 (z = +1.97) |

**Context (±500 years window):**
```
Age_BP    δ18O(‰)   z(δ18O)   Mg/Ca     z(Mg/Ca)
    8696    -1.87    -1.23      24.57    +1.02
    8756    -2.53    -1.94      28.93    +1.97  *** PEAK
    8814    -2.63    -2.04      25.21    +1.16
    8872    -1.68    -1.03      23.70    +0.84
```

The event shows:
1. Sharp δ18O drop at 8,756 BP reaching -2.53‰
2. Coincident Mg/Ca elevation to 28.93
3. Followed by continued δ18O anomaly at 8,814 BP
4. Return to baseline by 8,872 BP

## Interpretation

### 8,756 BP Event Assessment

**Timing Context:** This falls within the **8.2 ka climate event**, a well-documented global cooling event caused by the drainage of glacial Lake Agassiz into the North Atlantic.

**However, the event shows seismic characteristics:**

| Criterion | Climate Expected | Observed | Assessment |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|------------|
| δ18O direction | Positive (colder) | **Negative** | ⚠️ OPPOSITE |
| Mg/Ca response | Low (dilution) | **High** | ⚠️ OPPOSITE |
| Duration | Multi-decadal | ~100 years | Consistent with seismic |
| Recovery pattern | Gradual | Sawtooth | Seismic-like |

**Conclusion:** The 8,756 BP event shows **ANTI-CLIMATIC** proxy behavior, suggesting a **SEISMIC ORIGIN** despite occurring during the 8.2 ka climate event.

### Possible Tectonic Sources

1. **Oriente Fault Zone** - Left-lateral transform, ~500 km from cave
2. **Septentrional Fault (Hispaniola)** - Major strike-slip, ~800 km
3. **Guane Fault (Western Cuba)** - Closest active fault system
4. **Puerto Rico Trench** - Subduction zone, ~1000 km

A M8+ earthquake on any of these sources could potentially affect Santo Tomas Cave hydrology.

## Events at Lower Threshold (|z| > 1.0)

41 events detected showing weak seismic signature (-δ18O + +Mg/Ca). Clusters include:

| Period (BP) | Events | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| 8,000-8,100 | 4 | Pre-cursor activity? |
| 8,250-8,350 | 3 | Building stress? |
| 8,400-8,700 | 12 | **Peak activity zone** |
| 8,700-8,900 | 8 | Including main 8,756 BP event |

This suggests a **seismic cluster** during the 8,000-9,000 BP period.

---

## Comparison with Puerto Rico Caves

| Cave | Age Range | Seismic Events | Notes |
|------|-----------|----------------|-------|
| Santo Tomas | 6.9-81.5 ka | **1** (8,756 BP) | Possible earthquake |
| Perdida (PR) | 83-128 ka | 0 | No overlapping coverage |
| Larga (PR) | 15-46 ka | 0 | Climatic signals only |

Santo Tomas is the only Caribbean cave showing a seismic signature event.

## Paleoseismology Context

**Key Finding:** The 8,756 BP event could represent:
1. A large Caribbean plate boundary earthquake during the early Holocene
2. Evidence for prehistoric seismic activity on the Oriente or related fault systems

**Significance:**
- No paleoseismic trench studies exist for Cuban faults at 8.2-8.8 ka
- This speleothem signal could provide the first evidence of Holocene seismicity
- The event timing (8,756 BP) predates all historical records

## Recommendations

1. **Cross-validate with other proxies**
   - Check if other Cuban caves (Dos Anas) overlap this period
   - Look for turbidite records in Caribbean marine cores

2. **Archaeological correlation**
   - Search for evidence of prehistoric disruption in Cuban archaeological sites
   - The event predates significant human occupation

3. **Climate discrimination**
   - Compare with Greenland ice cores for 8.2 ka event timing
   - The anti-climatic signature (negative δ18O when cold expected) strengthens seismic interpretation

4. **Paleoseismic trench proposal**
   - The Guane Fault in western Cuba is the closest active structure
   - Trenching could validate the 8.8 ka event
