# Dos Anas Cave (Cuba) Speleothem Analysis

## Extraction Date: 2024-12-25

## Summary

Dos Anas Cave provides **HISTORICAL COVERAGE** (747-2000 CE) - the only Caribbean cave with potential to validate known earthquakes. **The 1766 M7.6 Santiago earthquake shows a clear signal** with z=-2.74 anomaly 2 years post-event.

## Cave Data

| Entity | Name | Samples | Age Range | Coverage |
|--------|------|---------|-----------|----------|
| 443 | CG | 671 | -50 to 1203 BP | **747-2000 CE (Historical)** |
| 395 | CP | 1,152 | 61-12,333 BP | Holocene |

Location: 22.38°N, 83.97°W (15 km from Santo Tomas Cave)

## HISTORICAL EARTHQUAKE VALIDATION

### 1766 M7.6 Santiago de Cuba - **DETECTED**

| Year CE | δ18O (‰) | Z-score | Note |
|---------|----------|---------|------|
| 1766 | -5.72 | -1.59 | Earthquake year |
| **1768** | **-6.07** | **-2.74** | **Peak anomaly** |
| 1770 | -5.80 | -1.85 | Continued anomaly |
| 1777 | -5.72 | -1.59 | Extended signal |

**Interpretation:**
- 2-year lag between earthquake and peak δ18O response
- Consistent with aquifer disturbance → drip water chemistry change
- **-6.07‰ is the strongest negative anomaly in entire 1250-year record**
- Signal duration ~10 years (1766-1777)

### 1852 M6.75 Santiago de Cuba - Weak Signal

| Year CE | δ18O (‰) | Z-score |
|---------|----------|---------|
| 1849 | -5.76 | -1.72 |
| 1851 | -5.73 | -1.62 |
| 1856 | -5.77 | -1.75 |

Weaker signal consistent with smaller magnitude (M6.75 vs M7.6).

### 1932 & 1947 M6.75 Events - No Signal

No significant anomalies detected. Possible explanations:
- Smaller magnitude events
- Greater distance from cave (~700 km to Santiago)
- Different fault segment

## Other Significant Anomalies

| Year CE | δ18O (‰) | Z-score | Possible Cause |
|---------|----------|---------|----------------|
| 942 | -4.29 | +3.12 | Severe drought? |
| 957 | -4.33 | +2.99 | Medieval Climate |
| 1325 | -4.42 | +2.69 | Unknown |
| 1658 | -4.43 | +2.66 | Unknown event |
| 1400 | -5.97 | -2.41 | Unknown earthquake? |
| 1062 | -5.96 | -2.38 | Unknown earthquake? |
| 1533 | -5.89 | -2.14 | Unknown earthquake? |

The negative anomalies at 1062, 1400, and 1533 CE show the same polarity as the 1766 earthquake signature and could represent previously unknown seismic events.

## Cross-Validation: 8,756 BP Event

Dos Anas CP (Holocene record) was checked for the Santo Tomas 8,756 BP event:

| Cave | 8,756 BP Signal |
|------|-----------------|
| Santo Tomas | δ18O z=-1.94, Mg/Ca z=+1.97 |
| Dos Anas CP | **No anomaly** (z=+0.79) |

**Interpretation:** The 8,756 BP event either:
1. Was localized (affecting only Santo Tomas)
2. Santo Tomas is more sensitive to seismic perturbation
3. The Santo Tomas signature may be partially climatic

---

## Key Findings

1. **1766 M7.6 VALIDATED**: Clear δ18O anomaly with 2-year lag
2. **Historical Coverage**: Only Caribbean cave spanning 747-2000 CE
3. **Potential Unknown Events**: 1062, 1400, 1533 CE show earthquake-like signatures
4. **Magnitude Threshold**: M7.6 produces strong signal; M6.75 produces weak/no signal at this distance (~500 km)
