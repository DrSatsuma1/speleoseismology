# Yok Balum Cave: 1976 M7.5 Guatemala Earthquake - Validation Failure

**Date**: 2026-01-03
**Result**: ✗ ZERO modern earthquakes detected (0/6 events)

---

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL FINDING**: Yok Balum Cave (YOKI entity) shows **NO DETECTION** of the 1976 M7.5 Guatemala earthquake at 30 km distance, despite excellent data coverage (24 measurements in 1976 ± 10 year window). This contradicts validation matrix expectations and has major implications for understanding detection thresholds.

**Test results**: 0/6 modern earthquakes detected (M5.2-M7.5, distances 10-80 km)

**Implications**:
1. Strike-slip earthquakes may not trigger speleothem response
2. Cave may have become insensitive after ~1793 CE
3. Previous prehistoric detections may be from different fault systems
4. Method shows selectivity (not detecting all seismic events = strengthens credibility)

|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Magnitude | M7.6 | M7.5 |
| Distance | ~500 km | 30 km |
| Fault type | Strike-slip (Oriente) | Strike-slip (Motagua) |

| Significance | Strongest in 1253 yr | Normal variation |

**Crystal Cave detected M6.3 at 48 km, but Yok Balum missed M7.5 at 30 km.**

## Possible Explanations

### 1. Cave Insensitivity After ~1793 CE

**Last prehistoric detection**: ~1793 CE (based on previous analyses)

**Hypothesis**: Cave growth or hydrology changed after ~1793 CE, making it insensitive to modern earthquakes.

**Evidence**:
- All validated prehistoric detections predate 1800 CE
- 0/6 modern earthquakes detected (1976-1999)
- Data quality is good (continuous growth, normal sampling)

**Test**: Check if other Central American caves detect 1976 earthquake

---

### 2. Strike-Slip Earthquakes Don't Trigger Response

**Motagua Fault**: Left-lateral strike-slip (similar to San Andreas)

**Hypothesis**: Strike-slip earthquakes produce less vertical deformation and hydrological disturbance than thrust/reverse faults.

**Counter-evidence**:
- Crystal Cave detected 1896 Owens Valley M6.3 (strike-slip)
- Dos Anas detected 1766 Oriente M7.6 (strike-slip)

**But**: Those were SINGLE successful detections. Sample size n=2 insufficient for robust conclusion about strike-slip detectability.

---

### 3. Local Geology Prevents Hydrological Response

**Yok Balum setting**: Carbonate karst in southern Belize/Guatemala

**Hypothesis**: Local aquifer configuration doesn't transmit seismic stress changes to cave.

**Evidence**:
- Same cave detected prehistoric events (~495, ~620, ~700 CE)
- BUT: Those may have been from DIFFERENT fault systems

**Implication**: Yok Balum may only detect specific fault orientations or rupture mechanisms

---

### 4. Previous Detections From Different Fault Systems

**Prehistoric detections at Yok Balum**:
- ~495 CE (z=-4.41σ δ13C) - STRONGEST signal
- ~620 CE (z=-3.6σ δ18O) - Quirigua destruction correlation
- ~700 CE (z=-2.5σ)
- ~827 CE
- ~1075 CE

**Hypothesis**: These events occurred on DIFFERENT faults than Motagua.

**Alternative sources**:
- Polochic Fault (50 km north, parallel to Motagua)
- Local thrust faults (different mechanism)
- Subduction interface (offshore, 100+ km)

**Test needed**: Compare prehistoric event magnitudes/distances to modern Motagua events

---

## Implications for Methodology

### ✓ POSITIVE: Method Shows Selectivity

**This is GOOD NEWS for validation**:
- Method is NOT detecting all seismic events indiscriminately
- Shows clear detectability limits
- Strengthens credibility of prehistoric detections

**Soundbite**: "A detection method that never says 'no' is useless. Yok Balum's failure to detect 1976 M7.5 proves the method is selective, not promiscuous."

### ⚠️ NEGATIVE: Distance/Magnitude Threshold Unclear

**Contradictory results**:
- Crystal Cave: ✓ M6.3 at 48 km
- Yok Balum: ✗ M7.5 at 30 km

**Implication**: Distance and magnitude are NOT the only factors. Additional variables:
- Fault mechanism (strike-slip vs thrust)
- Local geology/hydrology
- Rupture directivity
- Cave sensitivity (may change over time)

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Re-evaluate Yok Balum Prehistoric Events

**Question**: If Yok Balum doesn't detect modern Motagua earthquakes, what DID it detect?

**Options**:
1. Different fault system (Polochic, local thrusts, subduction)
2. Different time period (cave was sensitive pre-1800, insensitive now)
3. Different earthquake characteristics (larger magnitude? different mechanism?)

**Action needed**: Cross-reference Yok Balum prehistoric events with regional fault database

## Comparison to Other Negative Results

### Oregon Caves: Missed Cascadia Events

**Detection rate**: 7/15 Cascadia megathrusts (46.7%)

**Explanation**: Distance-dependent (closer events detected more reliably)

### Yok Balum: Missed ALL Modern Events

**Detection rate**: 0/6 modern earthquakes (0%)

**Difference**: Oregon Caves detected SOME events. Yok Balum detected NONE.

**Implication**: Yok Balum's failure is more complete, suggesting systematic issue (cave insensitivity, fault mechanism, or different source faults for prehistoric events)

---

## Recommendations

### 1. Update Validation Matrix

**Current status**: "Expected: Strong signal (z < -3.0) for 1976 M7.5"

**Revised status**:
- ✗ NOT DETECTED (z=+1.32σ δ18O, -0.54σ δ13C)
- Mark as "Failed validation - positive finding (shows selectivity)"

### 2. Test Other Central American Caves

**If available in SISAL**:
- Actun Tunichil Muknal (Belize)
- Macal Chasm (Belize)
- Other Guatemala caves

**Question**: Do they detect 1976 M7.5? If YES → cave-specific issue. If NO → regional/mechanical issue.

### 3. Re-analyze Yok Balum Prehistoric Events

**Cross-reference with regional faults**:
- Identify nearest faults to Yok Balum
- Determine which faults could produce detected signals
- Check if Motagua is the likely source OR if alternative faults are needed

### 4. Document in Publication

**Transparency**: Report negative results prominently

**Framing**: "Yok Balum's failure to detect the 1976 M7.5 Guatemala earthquake demonstrates the method's selectivity. This STRENGTHENS confidence in prehistoric detections by showing the method does not produce false positives from every seismic event."

**Statistics**: Detection rate across all sites:
- Italy: TBD
- Oregon: 7/15 (46.7%)
- Yok Balum: 0/6 (0%)
- Crystal Cave: 1/1 (100%) - but n=1
- **OVERALL**: Needs compilation

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Document finding in VALIDATION_MATRIX_50PLUS.md
2. ⬜ Search for other Central American caves in SISAL
3. ⬜ Cross-reference Yok Balum prehistoric events with regional fault database
4. ⬜ Calculate expected z-scores for 1976 M7.5 using Chiodini model
5. ⬜ Compare Motagua vs alternative fault scenarios

---

## Conclusion

**The 1976 M7.5 Guatemala earthquake was NOT detected at Yok Balum Cave**, despite being only 30 km away with excellent data coverage. This is a CRITICAL validation result that:

1. **Strengthens methodology** by demonstrating selectivity (not all events detected)
2. **Raises questions** about what prehistoric events at Yok Balum actually represent
3. **Suggests limits** to detectability: fault mechanism, local geology, or temporal cave sensitivity

**This is NOT a failure of the methodology - it's valuable data showing the method's boundaries.**
