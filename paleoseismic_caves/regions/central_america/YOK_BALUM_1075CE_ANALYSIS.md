# The 1066-1084 CE Anomaly at Yok Balum: Medieval Megadrought

## Executive Summary

**CLASSIFICATION**: **MEGADROUGHT** (Climatic, NOT Seismic)

**FINDING**: The 1066-1084 CE anomaly is a **pure climatic event** - specifically a prolonged megadrought during the Medieval Quiet Period. This is NOT a seismic event despite a previous (erroneous) classification.

**Key Evidence**:
1. **POSITIVE anomalies** on both proxies (opposite of seismic signature)
2. **Zero volcanic forcing** during Medieval Quiet Period (55-70% below average)
3. **Coupling ratio 0.52** = δ13C >> δ18O (drought signature, not seismic)
4. **18-year duration** consistent with prolonged climatic drought

**Correction Note**: CLAUDE.md previously listed this as "reclassified as SEISMIC" - this was an error based on flawed reasoning that "not volcanic = must be seismic." Pure climatic drought is a third option that fits the data.

## Data Summary

### Peak Values

| Proxy | Peak Z-Score | Year CE | Interpretation |
|-------|--------------|---------|----------------|
| δ18O | **+2.64** | 1070.2 CE | Reduced precipitation / evaporative enrichment |
| δ13C | **+4.96** | 1071.8 CE | Vegetation stress / soil respiration collapse |

### Coupling Ratio Analysis

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| Mean |δ18O Z| / |δ13C Z| | **0.52** | δ13C ~2x stronger than δ18O |
| Compare to seismic events | ~1.5 (620 CE, 1159 CE) | OPPOSITE pattern |

### Duration

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Onset | ~1050 CE (gradual) |
| Peak | 1066-1082 CE |
| Recovery | ~1088-1095 CE |
| **Total duration** | **~38 years** (extreme onset-recovery) |
| **Peak duration** | **~16 years** (z > +2 sustained) |

## Why This Is NOT Seismic

### Comparison with Known Seismic Events

| Event | δ18O Z | δ13C Z | Ratio | Direction |
|-------|--------|--------|-------|-----------|
| **620 CE (seismic)** | **-3.63** | **-2.36** | **1.54** | **NEGATIVE** |
| **1159 CE (seismic)** | **-2.67** | **-1.77** | **1.51** | **NEGATIVE** |
| **1066-1084 CE** | **+2.64** | **+4.96** | **0.52** | **POSITIVE** |

The 1066-1084 CE event shows the **OPPOSITE** pattern:
1. Both proxies go POSITIVE (not negative)
2. δ13C is 2x stronger than δ18O (ratio 0.52, not 1.5)

### Seismic Mechanism Review

For earthquakes (Chiodini model):
- Deep aquifer disruption → OLD water with LIGHTER isotopes → δ18O goes NEGATIVE
- CO₂ degassing → geogenic carbon → δ13C signature changes

The 1066-1084 event shows:
- δ18O goes POSITIVE (heavier isotopes = DRIER, not wetter)
- δ13C goes POSITIVE (reduced soil respiration = vegetation stress)

This is the classic **drought signature**, not seismic.

## Why This Is NOT Volcanic

### Medieval Quiet Period (eVolv2k v4)

The eVolv2k database explicitly identifies 950-1100 CE as the **Medieval Quiet Period**:

> "Periods of decreased volcanic activity occurred between 950 and 1100 CE (Medieval Quiet Period)... During these time intervals annual mean VSSI was **55 to 70% less than the long-term mean**."

### Volcanic Events 1050-1100 CE

| Year | Latitude | VSSI (Tg S) | Significance |
|------|----------|-------------|--------------|
| 1057 | 45°N | 0.83 | NEGLIGIBLE |
| 1064 | 45°N | 0.94 | NEGLIGIBLE |
| 1067 | 45°N | 0.67 | NEGLIGIBLE |
| 1092 | 45°S | 0.23 | NEGLIGIBLE |

Compare to major eruptions:
- 1108 CE: 19.16 Tg S
- 1230 CE: 23.78 Tg S
- 1257 Samalas: 59.42 Tg S

The eruptions during 1050-1100 CE are **20-90x smaller** than major events and would not produce multi-decadal climate anomalies.

## Drought Interpretation

### Physical Mechanism

1. **Reduced precipitation** → evaporative enrichment → δ18O becomes LESS negative (positive Z)
2. **Vegetation stress** → reduced soil respiration → less biogenic CO₂ → δ13C becomes LESS negative (positive Z)
3. **Prior Calcite Precipitation (PCP)** → enhanced during low-water conditions → amplifies δ13C signal
4. **δ13C >> δ18O** because vegetation stress affects δ13C more directly than precipitation affects δ18O

### Archaeological/Historical Context

| Period | Event |
|--------|-------|
| 800-1000 CE | Terminal Classic Maya Collapse |
| 1000-1200 CE | Early Postclassic Period |
| 1050-1100 CE | **Medieval Warm Period / Medieval Climate Anomaly** |

The 1066-1084 CE drought occurs during the Medieval Warm Period, when Central America experienced documented megadroughts. This is consistent with paleoclimate reconstructions from multiple proxies (lake sediments, tree rings, other speleothems).

### Comparison with Other Yok Balum Droughts

The Yok Balum record shows multiple positive δ18O excursions:
- ~810-860 CE: Terminal Classic drought (associated with Maya collapse)
- **1066-1084 CE: Medieval Warm Period drought** (this event)
- Other positive excursions in the record

## Conclusion and Classification

### Reasoning

1. **POSITIVE anomalies** on both proxies - OPPOSITE of seismic signature
2. **Coupling ratio 0.52** - δ13C >> δ18O, characteristic of drought (not seismic ratio of ~1.5)
3. **Medieval Quiet Period** - zero significant volcanic forcing rules out volcanic cause
4. **18-year duration** - consistent with prolonged megadrought
5. **Medieval Warm Period context** - documented droughts in Central America during this interval

### Classification

| Status | Classification | Confidence |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| **FINAL** | **MEGADROUGHT (Climatic)** | **HIGH** |

### Previous Erroneous Classification

CLAUDE.md previously stated this was "reclassified as SEISMIC" based on:
- "Coupling ratio 0.52 = STRONGEST COUPLING"
- "Medieval Quiet Period = NO volcanic forcing"

This reasoning was flawed:
- "No volcanic" does NOT mean "must be seismic"
- Pure climatic drought is a third option
- The POSITIVE direction and 0.52 ratio are diagnostic of DROUGHT

### Correction Required

Update CLAUDE.md to remove this event from the seismic event count and classify correctly as climatic/drought.

## Implications

### For Publication Strategy

This analysis REDUCES the seismic event count at Yok Balum:
- Previous claim: 7 seismic events
- Corrected: **6 seismic events** (~495, 620, 700, 827, 936, 1310 CE)

### For Methodology

This analysis demonstrates the importance of **direction** (positive vs negative) in proxy interpretation, not just coupling ratio. A low coupling ratio with POSITIVE anomalies indicates drought; the same ratio with NEGATIVE anomalies would indicate potential seismic.
