# The 1276 CE Mega-Anomaly at Yok Balum: Volcanic or Seismic?

## Executive Summary

**FINDING**: The 1276.6 CE event (z = -3.77) is the **STRONGEST single-year δ18O anomaly** in the entire 2000-year Yok Balum record, surpassing even the 620 CE earthquake discovery (z = -3.63).

**KEY DISCRIMINATION**: Unlike the 620 CE event, the 1276 CE anomaly shows **decoupled proxy behavior**:
- δ18O: z = -3.77 (EXTREME)
- δ13C: z = -1.18 (MODERATE)

This **δ18O-only pattern** is more consistent with **volcanic climate forcing** than seismic aquifer disruption.

## Data Summary

### Peak Event

| Year | δ18O (‰) | δ18O Z | δ13C (‰) | δ13C Z | Pattern |
|------|----------|--------|----------|--------|---------|
| 1276.6 CE | -5.090 | **-3.77** | -9.180 | -1.18 | δ18O >> δ13C |

### Full Anomaly Window (1273-1279 CE)

| Year | δ18O Z | δ13C Z | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|-------|
| 1273.0 | -2.62 | -0.49 | Onset |
| 1273.8 | -2.48 | -0.55 | |
| 1274.7 | -1.46 | -0.81 | Brief partial recovery |
| 1275.7 | -3.07 | -0.80 | Intensification |
| **1276.6** | **-3.77** | **-1.18** | **PEAK** |
| 1277.5 | -1.80 | -0.36 | |
| 1278.3 | -2.34 | -0.70 | |
| 1279.2 | -1.97 | -0.38 | Recovery |

**Duration**: ~6 years (1273-1279 CE)

## Comparison: 1276 CE vs. 620 CE

| Feature | 620 CE Event | 1276 CE Event |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| Peak δ18O Z | -3.63 | **-3.77** (stronger) |
| Peak δ13C Z | **-2.36** | -1.18 (weaker) |
| Duration | 46 years | 6 years |
| Structure | Two distinct pulses | Single pulse |
| δ18O-δ13C coupling | **COUPLED** (both strong) | **DECOUPLED** (δ18O only) |
| Pattern | Seismic signature | Climatic signature |

**Critical Difference**: At 620 CE, BOTH proxies showed strong anomalies with identical two-pulse structure. At 1276 CE, δ13C shows only a moderate response.

## Hypothesis 1: 1257 Samalas Volcanic Aftermath

### The 1257 Samalas Eruption

- **Date**: 1257 CE (possibly early 1258)
- **VEI**: 7 (among the largest Holocene eruptions)
- **Location**: Lombok, Indonesia
- **Sulfate injection**: ~250 Tg (possibly largest of past 12,000 years)
- **Climate impact**: "Year without summer" effects documented in European chronicles

### Volcanic Forcing Mechanism

1. **Sulfate aerosols** → atmospheric cooling → isotopically lighter precipitation (depleted δ18O)
2. **Reduced evaporation** → increased effective moisture → cave drip rate increase
3. **Hydrological reorganization** → multi-year isotopic response

### Timing Analysis

| Event | Date | Lag from Samalas |
|-------|------|------------------|
| Samalas eruption | 1257/1258 CE | 0 |
| First elevated δ18O anomaly | 1257.8 CE | ~0 years |
| Secondary peak | 1259-1265 CE | 2-8 years |
| **Major anomaly peak** | **1276.6 CE** | **~19 years** |

The 19-year lag seems long for direct volcanic forcing. However:
- Major volcanic eruptions can trigger multi-decadal ocean-atmosphere feedbacks
- The Samalas eruption may have initiated an ENSO-like response with delayed secondary effects
- The 1260s show a distinct intermediate anomaly cluster

### Evidence FOR Volcanic Origin

1. **δ13C NOT strongly affected** - volcanic cooling affects precipitation isotopes but not the carbon cycle
2. **Short duration** (6 years vs 46 years for 620 CE) - volcanic events typically shorter
3. **Single pulse structure** - no delayed rupture sequence like the seismic 620 CE event
4. **Global volcanic marker** - 1257/1258 is the largest volcanic event near this time
5. **First anomaly at 1257** - immediate response then building to delayed peak

## Hypothesis 2: Unknown Central American Earthquake

### Potential Seismic Sources

| Fault System | Distance from Yok Balum | Capability |
|--------------|-------------------------|------------|
| Motagua Fault | ~50 km | M7.5+ capable |
| Polochic Fault | ~100 km | M7+ capable |
| Middle America Trench | ~300 km | M8+ capable (subduction) |

### Evidence AGAINST Seismic Origin

1. **δ13C NOT strongly affected** - seismic events should affect BOTH proxies (as with 620 CE)
2. **No archaeological evidence** - Maya archaeological record does not document destruction events at 1276 CE
3. **Short duration** - if seismic aquifer disruption, expect longer recovery (cf. 46 years at 620 CE)
4. **No two-pulse structure** - seismic events often show mainshock + aftershock sequence

### Evidence FOR Seismic Origin

1. **Extreme magnitude** (z = -3.77) - largest single-year anomaly in record
2. **Located in seismically active zone** - Motagua Fault is capable of major earthquakes
3. **Cannot rule out** - paleoseismic records for this period are sparse

## Archaeological Context (1270-1290 CE)

### Maya Postclassic Period

The 1270s fall within the **Late Postclassic Maya** period:
- Mayapan was the dominant center (established ~1220 CE)
- No major documented destruction events in the 1270s
- Mayapan's eventual decline is dated to ~1441-1461 CE (much later)

### Contrast with 620 CE

The 620 CE event correlates with documented:
- Quirigua buried under silt ("devastating flood")
- Tikal construction hiatus (557-692 CE)
- Maya "Dark Age" (540-640 CE)

No comparable disruption is documented for 1276 CE.

## Conclusion and Classification

| Assessment | Confidence |
|------------|------------|
| **VOLCANIC (1257 Samalas aftermath)** | **70%** |
| SEISMIC (unknown earthquake) | 20% |
| Other/unknown | 10% |

### Reasoning

1. The **decoupled proxy behavior** (strong δ18O, weak δ13C) is inconsistent with the seismic signature established at 620 CE
2. The 1257 Samalas eruption provides a **known, documentable forcing mechanism**
3. The **lack of archaeological disruption** argues against a major local earthquake
4. The **short duration** (6 years) is more consistent with volcanic aftermath than aquifer reorganization

### Recommended Classification

**Status**: CLIMATIC (Volcanic Forcing - 1257 Samalas Aftermath)

**NOT recommended for paleoseismic interpretation**
