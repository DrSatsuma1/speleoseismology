# 1394 ± 13 yr Ligurian Anomaly: Alternative Explanations Assessment

**Analysis Date**: 2026-01-03
**Purpose**: Systematically evaluate non-seismic explanations for the 1394 anomaly
**Status**: EARTHQUAKE REMAINS MOST LIKELY, but not confirmed

---

## Dating Uncertainty

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Central estimate | 1394 CE |
| U-Th uncertainty | ±13 years (2σ) |
| **Actual window** | **1377-1403 CE** |
| Peak sample depth | 27.67 mm |

**IMPORTANT**: Any alternative explanation must fit the 1377-1403 window, not just "1394."

---

## Alternative Explanations Evaluated

### 1. VOLCANIC ERUPTION - RULED OUT

**Databases checked**:
- GVP (Smithsonian Global Volcanism Program): No VEI≥3 eruptions 1375-1415
- eVolv2k (Toohey & Sigl 2017): No sulfate forcing events 1375-1415 with VSSI>1 Tg S
- Cave-specific volcanic check: No major eruptions in window

**Conclusion**: No volcanic activity that could explain the anomaly.

### 2. DROUGHT - UNLIKELY BUT NOT EXCLUDED

**Evidence AGAINST drought**:

1. **Klapferloch cross-cave signal**: Austria (400+ km away) shows δ13C **+2.27σ** at ~1394
   - Elevated (positive) δ13C indicates **geogenic CO₂**, not biogenic
   - Local drought at Bàsura wouldn't affect a cave 400 km away
   - This is the strongest evidence against drought

2. **Mg/Ca temporal shape**: Onset slope 0.867 σ/mm exceeds climatic threshold
   - "Shark fin" pattern (rapid onset) is seismic signature
   - Drought produces "hump" pattern (gradual onset)

3. **Mg/Ca polarity**: +1.60σ (positive/elevated)
   - Seismic events typically produce HIGH Mg/Ca (deep water)
   - Some droughts produce LOW Mg/Ca (reduced water-rock contact)
   - However, severe drought CAN produce high Mg/Ca via evaporative concentration

**Evidence FOR drought (cannot fully exclude)**:

1. **5-year recovery** is shorter than typical seismic (>10 years)
2. **No δ13C from Bàsura itself** - cannot directly confirm geogenic vs biogenic CO₂
3. **1380s-1390s droughts documented** in parts of Europe (Old World Drought Atlas)
4. **Little Ice Age transition** - climate was variable in this period

**Key resource**: [Old World Drought Atlas](https://www.drought.gov/data-maps-tools/old-world-drought-atlas) - should check PDSI for Liguria 1377-1403

**Probability**: ~20%

---

### 3. BLACK DEATH / PLAGUE - UNLIKELY

**Context**: Second Pandemic recurred every ~10 years in late 1300s Italy ([PMC review](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2630035/))

**Evidence AGAINST plague**:
- Archival wills use "timens subitaneam mortem" (fearing sudden death) WITHOUT illness terminology
- Notaries would note "pestilentia" or "morbo" for plague deaths
- The mortality spike is geographically concentrated in mountain hinterland, not following plague spread patterns

**Probability**: <5%

---

### 4. FLOOD - RULED OUT

**Evidence**:
- No documented floods in Liguria 1390s
- Systematic Liguria flood records don't begin until 1511 CE
- Low Countries had flooding in 1394, but that's 1000+ km away

**Sources**: [Historical flooding in NW Apennines](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1040618224002696)

**Probability**: <1%

---

### 5. LITTLE ICE AGE CLIMATE SHIFT - UNLIKELY

**Context**:
- Medieval Warm Period ended ~1300 CE
- Initial cooling phase ~1300, severe cold phase ~1560
- 1390s falls in transitional period

**Evidence AGAINST**:
- No evidence of abrupt climate shift specifically in 1377-1403
- Klapferloch cross-cave signal argues against regional climate cause
- Mg/Ca temporal shape doesn't match climatic pattern

**Sources**: [Little Ice Age overview](https://www.science.smith.edu/climatelit/the-effects-of-the-little-ice-age/)

**Probability**: ~5%

---

### 6. EARTHQUAKE - MOST LIKELY

**Evidence FOR seismic origin**:

1. **δ18O anomaly**: -2.16σ (3rd strongest in 750-year record)
2. **Mg/Ca elevation**: +1.60σ (consistent with deep water intrusion)
3. **Klapferloch δ13C**: +2.27σ at ~1394 (geogenic CO₂ signature, 400 km away)
4. **Temporal shape**: "Shark fin" onset (0.867 σ/mm) above climatic threshold
5. **Historical context**: Falls in 319-year catalog gap (1217-1536 CE)
6. **Archival hints**:
   - Bell tower collapse 1392 (structural precursor?)
   - Vatican "ruina et paupertas" petitions 1394-1395
   - Localized mortality spike in hinterland
   - Tax waiver for Albenga 1395

**Evidence AGAINST / Gaps**:
1. **No δ13C from Bàsura itself**
2. **5-year recovery** is borderline short
3. **No CFTI5Med entry** for 1377-1403 in Liguria (but this is expected for "dark" events)

**Probability**: ~70%

## Summary Table

| Mechanism | Probability | Key Evidence |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Earthquake** | **~70%** | Klapferloch δ13C +2.27σ, Mg/Ca +1.60σ, shark fin onset |
| Drought | ~20% | Cannot exclude without Bàsura δ13C; 5-yr recovery is short |
| Unknown | ~5% | Something not considered |
| Climate shift | ~5% | Little Ice Age transition period |
| Plague | <5% | Archival language argues against |
| Volcanic | <1% | No eruptions in databases |
| Flood | <1% | No documentation |

## What Would CONFIRM Seismic Origin

1. **δ13C measurement from Bàsura** at 27.67mm depth showing > -8‰ (geogenic)
2. **Historical document** mentioning earthquake/damage in Liguria 1377-1403
3. **OWDA check** showing NO severe drought in Liguria during the window

## What Would REFUTE Seismic Origin

1. **OWDA showing severe drought** (PDSI < -3) in Liguria 1377-1403
2. **δ13C from Bàsura** showing < -10‰ (biogenic carbon)
3. **CFTI5Med discovery** of a documented earthquake explaining the signal

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Check CFTI5Med manually for ANY events 1377-1403 within 100 km of Bàsura (44.13°N, 8.21°E)
2. [ ] Access Old World Drought Atlas for Liguria PDSI 1377-1403
3. [ ] Contact Marta Zunino (Bàsura cave manager) about δ13C measurements
4. [ ] Search French National Archives for Adorno proceedings 1394-1396
