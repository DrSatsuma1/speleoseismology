# The 1887 M6.9 Ligurian Earthquake: A Critical Validation Test

## Executive Summary

**FINDING: The 1887 Ligurian earthquake (Mw 6.9) produced NO detectable signal in the Bàsura Cave speleothem record.**

This is a significant result that requires explanation before publication. The 1887 event is the best-documented historical earthquake in the study area, yet it shows no speleothem response.

## Speleothem Data Analysis

### δ18O Record (1880-1895 CE)

| Year | δ18O (‰) | Z-score | Notes |
|------|----------|---------|-------|
| 1880.9 | -6.226 | -0.82 | |
| 1883.1 | -5.712 | +0.89 | |
| 1884.3 | -5.897 | +0.28 | |
| 1885.3 | -5.871 | +0.36 | |
| 1886.4 | -5.899 | +0.27 | Pre-earthquake |
| **1887.4** | **-5.911** | **+0.23** | **EARTHQUAKE YEAR** |
| 1888.4 | -6.165 | -0.62 | Post-earthquake |
| 1890.3 | -6.100 | -0.40 | |
| 1891.4 | -6.240 | -0.87 | |
| 1892.5 | -5.777 | +0.68 | |
| 1893.6 | -6.188 | -0.70 | |
| 1894.7 | -6.063 | -0.28 | |

**Baseline Statistics**: Mean = -5.979‰, σ = 0.300‰

**Result**: δ18O at 1887 is z = +0.23 (essentially at baseline - NO ANOMALY)

### Mg/Ca Record (1880-1895 CE)

| Year | Mg/Ca (mmol/mol) | Z-score | Notes |
|------|------------------|---------|-------|
| 1880.9 | 20.831 | -0.90 | |
| 1883.1 | 20.733 | -0.93 | |
| 1884.3 | 20.806 | -0.91 | |
| 1886.4 | 20.885 | -0.88 | Pre-earthquake |
| **1888.4** | **21.347** | **-0.73** | **Post-earthquake** |
| 1890.3 | 22.390 | -0.38 | |
| 1891.4 | 24.080 | +0.19 | |
| 1893.6 | 25.577 | +0.69 | |
| 1894.7 | 26.909 | +1.13 | |

**Baseline Statistics**: Mean = 23.518, σ = 2.994

**Result**: Mg/Ca at 1888 is z = -0.73 (BELOW baseline, opposite of seismic signature)

## Comparison with 1285 and 1394 "Dark Earthquakes"

| Event | Magnitude | Distance | δ18O Z | Mg/Ca Z | Signal? |
|-------|-----------|----------|--------|---------|---------|
| **1285** | Moderate-to-strong* | ~20 km (onshore) | **-2.32** | **+2.25** | **STRONG** |
| **1394** | Moderate* | ~20 km (onshore) | **-2.05** | **+1.60** | **STRONG** |
| **1887** | Mw 6.9 | ~35-40 km (offshore) | **+0.23** | **-0.73** | **NONE** |

## Possible Explanations

### 1. Offshore vs. Onshore Rupture
The 1887 earthquake ruptured the offshore Ligurian thrust system, not the onshore Toirano fault zone that feeds Bàsura Cave's aquifer. The seismic energy may not have been transmitted to the karst system.

**Supporting Evidence**:
- 1285/1394 events hypothesized as ruptures on Toirano-Albenga onshore fault segment
- 1887 epicenter was ~20 km offshore in the Ligurian Sea
- Different stress transfer pathways for offshore vs. onshore events

### 2. Aquifer Depth and Connectivity
The 1887 ground motion may not have exceeded the threshold for aquifer disruption at Bàsura's drip water source depth.

**Consideration**:
- 1285/1394 may have involved deeper crustal disruption affecting bedrock aquifers
- 1887 may have primarily affected shallow coastal aquifers, not the Triassic dolomite system

### 3. Different Fault Geometry
The 1887 event was a thrust on a NNE-dipping offshore fault, while 1285/1394 may have been on the ENE-striking Toirano-Albenga system.

### 4. Temporal Resolution Limitation
Sample spacing around 1887 is ~1 year. If the signal was brief, it might have been missed. However, the 1285/1394 signals persisted for multiple samples, so this seems unlikely.

## Implications for Publication

### The Problem
We claim speleothems can detect M6+ earthquakes within ~300 km. The 1887 M6.9 at ~40 km produced no signal.

### Required Actions

1. **Acknowledge explicitly** that offshore earthquakes may not produce speleothem signals
2. **Refine the detection model**: "Onshore earthquakes affecting the local karst aquifer system"
3. **Frame as a constraint**: The method detects earthquakes that disrupt the specific aquifer, not all regional seismicity
4. **Turn into a strength**: This discrimination shows the method detects hydrogeological disruption, not just ground shaking

### Proposed Wording for Publication

> "The absence of a signal from the 1887 Mw 6.9 Ligurian earthquake, despite its greater magnitude, is consistent with its offshore epicenter (~35 km from the cave, ~20 km offshore). This suggests that speleothem paleoseismology is most sensitive to earthquakes that directly affect the onshore karst aquifer system, rather than detecting all regional seismicity. The 1285 and 1394 events, which produced strong signals, are hypothesized to have ruptured the onshore Toirano-Albenga fault segment that feeds Bàsura's drip water source."

## Additional Testing Needed

1. **1831 M5.5 Western Liguria earthquake**: Check for signal (onshore event)
2. **1564 Nice earthquake (~M6.0)**: Check for signal (may be at edge of record)
3. **1963 or 1970s instrumental events**: Check for minor anomalies
